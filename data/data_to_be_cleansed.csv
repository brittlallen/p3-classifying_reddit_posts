I‚Äôm slowly easing into my ‚Äúmaternity leave‚Äù, today being my first day off of work since April. I threw some laundry in and decided to take my 50lb German Shepherd Husky mix for a walk downtown. It‚Äôs a nice day (38 degrees is nice for December here lol), sun is shining, so why not enjoy it?

Well, I pass a Starbucks as two older ladies are leaving the shop. They immediately notice my very obvious 35w belly poking out from my sweater, then look at my dog in horror, and the one lady in her silly flower knit hat exclaims ‚ÄúYou should have a man doing that for you, you‚Äôre putting your baby in danger! What if she pulls you over!?‚Äù

I ignored her and kept walking. I know my dog, I know my limits, she clearly was just being dramatic.

6,"I ended up going to a different practice this pregnancy since my last pregnancy was a complete train wreck. My new ob looked over my records from my last pregnancy and asked me if my old practice did anything to treat my pre-eclampsia. I wasn't aware that I had pre-eclampsia. My blood pressure shot up alot near the end and I gained 40 pounds in a 2 week period, but I was told that was all normal and to not worry. I'm now very freaked out that this was all dismissed. I'm sorry I'm just venting. I had a very traumatic pregnancy only a year ago and things are all starting to crash down on me. I see a trauma therapist, but I'm still so scared to go through all this again. Being told I was pre-eclamptic and didn't even know is freaking me out even more.

My husband works at home for 4 out of the 5 days a week, but on the one day he goes in to the office I walk, (well, waddle) the mile to and from school to take our daughter there.

I know being pregnant has a lot to do with getting tired out whilst walking but I am so beyond exhausted on this walk to school. I feel like I have to push myself with every step when we're about half way there and feel so out of breath. My sides hurt too and I get stitches there which I'm assuming is related to the extra weight and babies position etc. Is it 'normal' to feel this tired out or am I just unhealthy? Or both? I thought walking whilst pregnant was a good way to keep active, but I really feel like I'm over-exerting myself!

Anyways she still has lots of her personal items in the basement/attic here so she came by to grab some stuff. 

Anyways she offered her crib to me and I thanked her for the offer but let her know I already had one. She insisted I try to return it so I could accept hers (the crib is from the 80s and has some sort of finish or something chipping off of it) I said no thanks and she went on to insist I take her old crib bumpers. I once again said thanks for the offer but actually people are told not to use crib bumpers these days. She completely scoffed at the idea of not using crib bumpers. Went on to say we‚Äôre born just to die anyways so there‚Äôs no sense in taking all these foolish safety precautions..... of course then she felt the need to go on and talk about how horrible birth was for her since she refused pain meds. She told me she hoped birth wouldn‚Äôt be so horrible for me... I made the mistake of saying that I planned on taking something for pain management and she went on to ask why I would ever do a thing like that. Ummm üôÑ.

I had asked MONTHS ago for family and friends planning on visiting to get the TDap shot. There are some who still haven't and say ""you can't keep family away from the baby, I'm her ____!"" It's the first baby on my mom's side of the family in 17 years so everyone is LOSING.THEIR.SHIT.

I also have friends who have never really been around a newborn so I thought I would make a general Facebook post asking people to kindly adhere to some ""rules"".

My uncle then commented ""A bit disrespectful &amp; abrasive to your family, ____. You‚Äôve forgotten that most of your family have experience raising children.  I think we know better"". I lost it and had an anxiety attack. I've been struggling with antenatal depression, worries over being a new mom, and knowing that my husband is leaving shortly after her birth for 7 months. 

Some people messaged me after seeing the comment and reassured me that I am doing the best for my daughter. I doubled down in my stance and replied ""I am sorry you feel disrespected over my boundaries regarding my child"".

15,"I never post and only lurk and find this a super supportive community so decided to finally post.

As a FTM at 34 weeks with a very complex medical history  I am now seeing a different medical professional daily, my medical team is made up of many consultants of different specialities to keep an eye on everything. Its pretty exhausting and expensive, however I am so happy the baby is doing great.

My husband is super supportive and has been my rock. My family on the other hand has not supported me at all, I don't expect anything but they have a special way of letting me down. For example mother has found a stroller in a dumpster which she rescued for me, its very broken, rusty, ripped, unsanitary and belongs in the dumpster. She keeps telling my extended family how she ""got me a pram"" as she purchased new ones for my nephew and niece. I have said nothing and purchased my own.

Today I met my family for dinner where they told me how selfish I am for wanting to have a child, my medical condition is not hereditary and I am able to work and care for this child. My sister who is a nurse then went on to say ""you are probably going to have a still born child so you better be prepared for that!"" I was ready to cry however I just smiled and continued my meal. I secretly wanted every one to stand up for me but no one did, they agreed with her.

The only reason I stay in contact with them is the hope they will someday care and treat me like they treat each other but after today I have realised my husband is the only person I care about. Sorry for the rant and thank you for listening x

I don‚Äôt feel as if my regular obgyn is informative or even compassionate towards me. This is my first pregnancy and I had literally no idea how anything is suppose to be and she treats me as if I should know. (I‚Äôm on insurance where it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to switch doctors. But we will be moving shortly after baby is born so I will have to get a new doctor.) 

Just for reference, she didn‚Äôt know why I was having pains/bleeding around 18 weeks and just dismissed it as growing pains. But I knew something else was wrong in my gut, so I went to the ER and they quickly found out it was placenta previa. 

Forwarding back to last week, I had this increasing very painful and sharp episodes lasting around 20 or seconds every 5-10 mins. I figured they‚Äôd resolve themselves if I just rested and slept well that night. Pain did not resolve and actually got much worse to where I was crying and screaming in pain each time those pains would arrive. I called my doctor after 24 of first noticing the pain, I got seen and baby‚Äôs heart was monitored. She dismissed it as just growing pains and to take Tylenol. The pain was so bad it was hard to walk, sit, lay, and even breathe. I‚Äôve been in pain ever since then and it‚Äôs hard to still do any daily activity. 

This morning it got much worse again and keeps happening. Idk if this is actually growing pains but I don‚Äôt feel as if the pains should be consistently hitting me on a schedule timing and nothing can cure/stop the pain.

19,"Title is pretty self-explanatory! Everyone has an idea in their head of how they want their birth experience to go, and I personally was hoping for a kinda crunchy, lower-intervention experience. For labor to start naturally, not needing drugs to kickstart it, etc. At our appt today at 39+1, our doctor told me I have ""the strongest cervix I've ever seen!"" and that baby girl will most likely not come out on her own before the 41 week deadline (the longest this practice will let a pregnancy go without intervention). She had us choose an induction date for next week and I'm feeling...scared? Disappointed? Both? I'm not happy that I will have to be strapped to the bed for the first 4 hours of Cervadil, I'm upset that my labor will probably be longer than it would have been naturally, I'm nervous about forcing my body through this process and possibly needing an emergency C-section as a result (my biggest fear). Obviously a healthy baby is the light at the end of the tunnel and I will do whatever is best for her to get her here safely, but I can't help but feel a little disappointed and way more apprehensive about labor than I was before induction was mentioned.

20,"Hello fellow expecting folks,

I just found out I was pregnant on Monday with a very faint line on a test at 10dpo. This was completely unplanned and I had been on the pill as my s/o and I are still in our early twenties and weren't necessarily planning on kids until our thirties. But, here we are! I'm not mad at it and neither is my baby's father. He is quite excited and that has made all of my emotions feel a little easier.

My problem is that I am driving myself crazy. Before around a week ago when I started to feel a little funny, I never thought seriously about being pregnant or how to prepare myself for that. I've always wanted children but now I'm here and I'm petrified by everything. I was a heavy cigarette smoker before pregnancy which I have now quit cold turkey (weirdly enough it's not been terribly difficult because they make me really sick now!) But I'm horrified that there are certainly still traces of all that crap in my body. I also have been in recovery from anorexia since just March of 2018. I wasn't even sure I could get pregnant anymore with how damaging my last relapse was and only just became weight restored a few months ago, and now I'm petrified that my body is somehow unfit for this pregnancy because of my eating disorder. I just got back to the point where I recognize my own face again, how could my body possibly be healthy enough to carry this child?!

I have an intuition that my baby will be okay, but I'm still so desperately anxious and I can't stop googling everything. I've taken more tests and they're all still faint which is making me scared as I'm now 12 dpo and the lines should have probably darkened by now...but I know that peeing on a stick is no science and I'm likely driving myself up a wall with no purpose! My boyfriend had to drag me out of the bathroom yesterday because I was just sitting there staring at all my tests and crying because I'm terrified to lose the baby. And then I spotted a tiny bit this morning, just a tad of brown and I'm at peak panic feelings.

Worse, I know that a doctor probably won't see me until 8-10 weeks and it feels impossible to wait that long! How did you all do it? How are you still doing it? I've been officially pregnant for two days and I think I'm losing my mind!",FTM at four weeks and totally in silent panic mode,1

This was almost laughable since I was hooked up to a blood pressure cuff that went off every hour on the hour. My husband and I were able to get some broken hours of sleep until 6 am the next day. The nurse woke us up, gave me the chance to shower, but warned me that the shower leaks into the room so don't run it longer than 10 minutes. By this point, I was feeling some mild cramps and was about 2 cm dilated. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 8 am, they started a pitocin drip to help move the process along. I was really concerned that with the increased contractions my blood pressure would raise, but it stayed under 120/80. By 10 am, my OB came to check on me and see if I had progressed, but I was still at 2 cm. She decided to break my water to get things moving. This was one of my biggest fears, because I had friends who told me how painful contractions were after having their water broke. It is really a weird experience for a FTM. I didn't realize ""breaking your water"" meant leaking everywhere for hours on end. Thankfully, the contractions weren't much worse than before and I was able to still walk around and use the labor ball to help make it through them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was continuing to receive higher dosages of pitocin to make my contractions stronger and more consistent. By 6 pm, my OB did another check to discover I was still at 2 cm. At this point, I wasn't in much pain but exhausted and upset to know that I didn't progress all day. I went to the bathroom while she was finishing up some notes with the nurse. When I came out, my husband asked if I wanted a chicken quesadilla. I laughed and said yes but was annoyed at the joke. My OB replied that it wasn't a joke and that she was going to let me eat dinner since this still could be a long haul. After not eating for more than 24 hours, you should have seen the smile on my face! 

&amp;#x200B;

By 9 pm, I felt another pop and it felt like the rest of my water broke. This is when my contractions started to get extremely painful. I called the nurse to get an epidural, and as luck would have it, the anesthesiologist had just gone into a c-section, so he wouldn't be available for another hour. This was one of the longest hours. I went into a cycle of going to the bathroom, walking around the room, bouncing on the labor ball, and getting back rubs from my husband. I was beyond ready for the epidural when the anesthesiologist arrived. My husband was asked to leave the room for the procedure, but the nurse stayed with me and held my hands as I was going through contractions while trying to keep still. It only took about fifteen minutes to feel complete relief.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been hopeful that the epidural would give me a chance to rest and boy was I wrong. About a half hour later, my blood pressure crashed from the epidural and went below 90/50. The anesthesiologist was called back to give me a shot of adrenaline. At the same time, I was given an oxygen mask because the baby's heart rate was dropping with each contraction. They had to put a monitor directly on the baby, which was difficult since I was still only 2 cm dilated. There was a rush of nurses coming in and out of the room keeping a close eye on my blood pressure and the baby's heart rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

By midnight, the nurse started me on antibiotics to prevent infections since it had been so long since my water was broken. At this point, I asked the nurse if by morning, I could just get a c-section. I had two friends who were induced and went longer than 24 hours. Both of their doctors recommended a c-section, so I thought that was normal procedure. The nurse said that my doctor ordered at least 3 more doses of antibiotics at six hour intervals, so it'll be some time before we need to progress to a c-section. My mood severely dropped and the only thing that kept me going was my husband's support. 

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, my OB gave me a break from the pitocin so I could get some rest and give the baby a break from contractions. I went to sleep immediately and woke up at 5:30 am to three nurses hovering above me, telling me to put the oxygen mask back on. I thought great, what more can go wrong. After another cervix check, the nurse said that the head was crowning and not to push until my doctor arrives. My husband and I were over the moon!! 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband queued up the delivery playlist and helped me ""blow out the candles"" to keep from pushing during contractions. After a long and frustrating labor, I have to say delivery was the easiest part! My OB arrived and she had me start pushing. Even with epidural, I was able to feel myself pushing but there was no pain. It only took four contractions and my little one arrived. The best feeling in the world was feeling the warmth from my newborn daughter on my chest afterward.  Here's my baby tax: [https://imgur.com/a/tREF31r](https://imgur.com/a/tREF31r)

&amp;#x200B;

Before going through labor and deliver, I had taken pre-natal yoga classes and a lamaze course, since I thought I would try to give birth without any medical interventions. After the blood pressure scare, I knew that I was going to have to accept the interventions, because they were what was best for my health and my little one's safety. I didn't realize that I would be literally having almost every medical intervention necessary. However, looking back on it, I'm thankful that my little one and I are safe and healthy, and we were able to recover so quickly. It has been a little over two weeks, and I'm feeling great. Most of my bleeding has stopped, I've been able to walk 3-4 miles a day, and my blood pressure is back to normal. Those interventions saved me from worse complications. 

&amp;#x200B;

One last note, new mom's take care of yourselves and your health. This is the best gift you can give your little one. I struggled with breastfeeding and ended up switching after a week to a combination of pumped milk and formula. It made me feel so guilty, but my husband was able to help with feedings and I was able to get some necessary rest. It has helped strengthen my bond with my daughter and she has gained back her birth weight and more with the mixture! My biggest suggestion is don't google anything. Trust your instincts, your doctor, and pediatrician. They will help make sure you are doing what's best for you and your family.  ","Birth Story: FTM, Induction, Chaotic Neutral",1

She said she has no experience with this, and has never heard of this (she has been practicing for 30 odd years??)

It should be noted that the ultrasound I had on Friday was HORRIBLE. The tech was inexperienced and in training. The baby wasn't cooperating for some of the measurements required and as a result she started pounding on my stomach was the ultrasound instrument trying to get baby to move. She became aggitated and asked that I go for a walk to see if the baby would move positions. He did not.

Not sure how to feel right now and I just need to get it all out.

Got my BFP on 12/7. Had some brown spotting on 12/8 and didn't get too concerned. Cue one episode of wiping with scant bright red blood. I tried not to freak out but deep inside resigned myself that this was it. I was going to lose this pregnancy. Then everything stopped later that night and I decided to see what happened. Everything was smooth sailing from there with constipation, bloating, aversions- all the ""good"" signs of pregnancy. 

The yesterday at 4 weeks 6 days I had some tiny red spotting again with light cramping. I decided this time to call the OB, but couldn't get in to the hospital for labs because I work a over an hour away. So we decided this morning is fine and to call if anything changed. Spotting turned brown and stopped last evening so I felt some relief but still had that nagging in the back of my mind. 

This morning the spotting had returned red but very light with some light cramping. As I was driving to the hospital the cramps got worse and I just knew I was bleeding more. And I was. Full on moderate period flow. 

After the labs I drove over an hour to work kind of zoned out. I honestly do not know how I feel. I was kind of just... waiting for it. Then I feel terrible for not feeling worse. Then I talk to my husband and my eyes well, but no crying. I'm kind of numb. 

I did call the OB back this morning and they're trying to get my labs back but still waiting. I was ordered to go back Thursday as well to see if it increases but I wonder if there is any point. 

I know there are people out there that bleed and go on to have successful pregnancies but I'm not hopeful. Then I feel bad about that. Like I'm giving up.

**TLDR**

I had my first contraction ever around 1pm when I was 36+6, and had a baby at 8:54pm. I had an epidural, and with very strong contractions and effective pushing for only 30 minutes, labor was easy for me. I pooped, peed, and threw up, then gave birth to a mostly healthy baby girl. She was jaundiced and spent some time in the NICU but we're all doing well now. 

---
**Conception and Pregnancy** 

I was really lucky, we decided to try and have a baby in early March, then my period never came in April. I was very healthy and active throughout pregnancy and didn't have any complications. My doctor said that I was making it look easy.

Wednesday 11/14 my doctor checked my cervix and it was at 1cm already, but apparently that doesn't mean anything. I was more tired than normal in the week before. I did have sex over the weekend, and regularly eat spicy foods. 

---
**How the big day started** 

On Monday, 11/19, I was 36+6. Woke up at 11am not hungry, and slightly nauseous (very out of the ordinary for me). 

I felt like I was leaking fluid, but little came out when I went to the toilet. It smelled like urine to me, and there wasn't much. Again, I hadn't been having bladder leaks at all, but I just thought ‚ÄúOh so I guess bladder leaks are happening now.‚Äù

I was also feeling constipated and pressure from the belly button down, no contractions, it was a constant feeling. I thought I was just bound up, just having a bad day. Again, this is normal for pregnant women in general, but wasn't for me. I had almost no stomach discomfort the whole pregnancy. I did get hungry and manage to eat a small breakfast at 12pm. 

---
**Labor signs** 

Some time between 1:00 and 1:30pm I started to think I was feeling contractions. These were basically the first time I had ever had contractions in my entire life. Anything I felt before that, I was never really positive if it was a contraction or kicks or gas. It was an uncomfortable tightening feeling all through my midsection. I started timing a about 1:30pm. 

For the hour and a half that I was timing them, the frequency was usually around 4-6 minutes apart, as many as 10 and as little as 3 a couple times. They lasted 30-60 seconds. Sometimes they felt like slight discomfort, and there were a few that made my face flush and nearly throw up.  In the beginning, I tried moving around and stretching a little, but quickly found that I was more comfortable on the couch with my heated blanket and snuggly cat. 

---
**Getting monitored at the clinic**

I called doctor at 2:45pm. Thinking that it would all go away on its own by the time I got there and I would feel silly, I called a friend for a ride just in case. Got in at 3:30pm and went on monitors for a little bit to track my contractions and baby's heart rate. The doctor checked my cervix and it was at 3cm. We talked about whether my water had broken, I said I was doubtful it had, but she said it felt broken to her, so she did the test and it turns out my water was broken! We don't really know when it broke, but the estimate they went with was 11am. I wish I could have seen the look on my face when she said, ‚ÄúSo you're having a baby today.‚Äù 

I called my husband as I getting dressed. He was already done at work so he was on his way home, and he got pulled over! Not because he was speeding, I guess he didn't slow down when he passed by a cop car who had pulled someone else over? The cop let him off with a warning, fortunately! Then I sent a quick message to my dad, and the friend that gave me a ride.  DH called my in-laws.  We didn‚Äôt really want the world to know outside of that.  Once I had my several layers of clothes and my coat back on, the nurse took me over to the hospital in a wheelchair and helped me get checked in.  She seemed happy when they told her which room to take me to.  I got a really good one. 

The nurses didn't feel the need to help me breathe through contractions, I was doing it well on my own, and I didn't use any of the the breathing exercises we went over in the birthing class. I just did what worked.  They asked me to rank my pain on that silly 1-10 scale.  I never know how to answer that question.  Pain is relative and memories of pain are unreliable.  I was sure that I was in much less pain than my dad was when he blew his hand up with a firework many years ago, but more than if I had stubbed my toe.  Before she could whip out the laminated paper with the color-coded smiley/frowny faces on it, I called it a 6.83 just to make the nurse happy.  She got a chuckle out of that, and decided to round it down to a 6 since I was still in such good spirits.  I also threw up twice by the time the doctor got to me. 

---
**Epidural**

The doctor came to see me around 5:00pm and we talked about pain management, among other things. When I had thought about this before, what I expected to happen was that I would want to move around and stretch to get through contractions until I decided it was too much and wanted rest, only then would I get the epidural. I also figured I wasn't very far along at this point, because labor doesn't usually go that fast in all the stories I've read!  It turned out I had no interest in moving around, I felt better just resting and relaxing in the bed while my husband talked to me and kept making me smile.  I decided to just go ahead and ask for an epidural. It was getting pretty uncomfortable and I knew that it could take 45 minutes to an hour for the anesthesiologist to get to me. 

The anesthesiologist got there at about 7pm. Having it inserted wasn't bad at all, didn‚Äôt hurt more than any other injection.  After about 20 minutes, I couldn't feel my contractions anymore. The epidural took away the pain, but I still had a lot of control of my legs. I could push my hips up off the bed a little. I could straighten and reach my legs off the sides of the bed. I could wiggle my toes. I also still had some feeling in my legs, I didn't feel like they were ‚Äúgone‚Äù or anything. 

Once it kicked in, I was really relaxed and felt really good. The nurse told me my contractions were looking very strong. The plan was to labor down for a while, and the doctor would come and check me soon. 

---
**Things started progressing quickly**

We waited around for about a half hour.  Then I told the nurses I was feeling a lot of pressure in my lower tummy and rectally, like I really needed a giant poop. I also started getting shaky in waves, sometimes making my teeth chatter. When I told them this, Their eyebrows hit the ceiling so the nurse decided to check my cervix. She said about 9.5 cm and I would be pushing soon. We were all so surprised! 

They hadn't even gotten around to putting in the catheter yet, so they decided to do a quicker type of catheter just to empty my bladder, instead of the one they would normally use which gets left in. I‚Äôve never had a catheter before so I had been nervous about this, but I didn‚Äôt feel anything at all.  She just fed it in, let my pee drain into a container, and then took it out.

I laid there for a little while, feeling that pressure come and go with my contractions. This part of the experience was actually really pleasurable. My body must have been pumping me with a lot of endorphins. It just felt right, it felt exciting and soothing. I've heard labor described as feeling like an ‚Äúout of body‚Äù experience, and that wasn't how I felt at all. I felt really connected and in tune with my body. 

---
**Push!**

Soon, the doctor came and it was time to start pushing. The nurse held one leg up for me and my husband held the other. I could still feel the pressure, but not pain, of the contractions, so I knew when it was time to push. The nurse was watching the monitors to help me time the pushes, but I knew it was coming before she did so we had it pretty coordinated. The nurse would count to ten as I pushed, I would take a quick breath, and then we would go again, three times per contraction. Nobody told me ‚Äúhow‚Äù to push, it was kind of like pooping. In fact, I did poop, which was actually one of the things I was most afraid of going into this, but at the time I didn't care. Anyways, I decided I wanted to see what was going on, so I asked for a mirror. It made my pushing even more efficient because then I could see the bits down there separating as my baby made her way out. Once I saw her head, I kept pushing with renewed vigor, sometimes doing four pushes per contraction instead of three. They were pretty much back to back anyway. 

After just 29 minutes of pushing, there she was. With help from the doctor, my husband caught her as she slid out. It made a really juicy sound and fluids spewed everywhere. They put her on my chest and I held her skin to skin as they pushed on my stomach to help the placenta come out. I still felt like I could push to help it come out and asked if she wanted me to. So she had me push a few times, and then I peed everywhere. Oops! 

Eventually the placenta came out. I don't think I felt it come out at all. It looked like a bloody slab of liver meat. Pretty cool. They delayed clamping the cord, and had my husband cut it when it was time. 

She did latch on and breastfeed within the first hour, but it was a struggle after that. 

Myra Jane was born at 8:54 pm, and six pounds eight ounces, 19.5 inches long, and with brown hair. Later, a nurse told me that based on the timing, I was probably 7 or 8 cm dilated by the time I actually got the epidural, so I probably could have gone without. Maybe, but I don't really have an interest in finding out. I enjoyed the experience and would make all the same choices if I had to do it over. All births are natural! 

---
**Recovering from the epidural**
 
Once things were all settled down, it was time for me to get out of bed and try to go to the bathroom. Although I could move my legs around in bed, standing and walking was a totally different story. With support from two nurses, I locked my knees and penguin shuffled my way to the bathroom, booty shaking the whole way, it was hilarious! I kind of ‚Äúdidn't know how‚Äù to go to the bathroom at first, which was weird, but the plumbing was all working again and I was able to walk within a couple hours. 

---
**The first few weeks**
 
So that's the story of the birth of my baby. Unfortunately, she was jaundiced, so we went into the NICU on day 2 and were there until the following Saturday, in and out of phototherapy and struggling to keep her fed. She breastfed a couple of times in the first two days but quickly got weaker until she couldn't latch at all (jaundice made her lethargic and not eating worsened her jaundice). I pumped like crazy and we used a few different tools (syringe with a tiny tube on a fingertip, bottles, nipple shields) but we've got it now. Getting to where she could latch on, stay latched, and suck vigorously for long enough to get adequately fed has been an adventure and there were times I wanted to quit, but I had good support from lactation consultants and now I'm glad I didn't. 

She's a pretty chill, predictable baby. She fusses whenever she needs something but rarely cries, she loves bath time, and is really good at getting her hands free from her swaddle.

---
**The motherly bond**

The moment she was placed in my arms was magical, and my husband says he wishes he had a picture of that moment. But from there, the bond wasn't totally automatic. I've even had times where I've resented her and her tedious feeding needs that made my nights lonely and miserable. Sometimes I didn't even think she was cute. I probably had baby blues for a bit but I feel better now.  Even though there were some negative feelings, there is nothing like quiet snuggles, carrying her around in my offbrand Moby, the warm fuzzy feeling that I get from breastfeeding, seeing her fall asleep so contently after a successful feed from nothing but a bare nipple after all that hard work, seeing my husband love on her‚Ä¶ I want what's best for her and I want her to have the best care I can give her, but we‚Äôre led to believe we‚Äôre supposed to be gushing with magical motherly right from the get-go; reality just isn‚Äôt that simple.  And I'm okay with that. She will grow and develop into a little human who smiles at me and wants to explore the world with me as her guide, even if she's just a needy little lump right now. I can't wait!

1) any tips on how to tell him and what things to stress out? I was thinking about telling him that a) I‚Äôm ok travelling next 3 months (as it will be necessary) and after baby is born, as my husband is supporting here, b) that I will take only 3 months off, as we have short maternity leave there, so he is not losing me for a long time. Anything else worth telling? 
2) Any tips from people who are further ahead on how to plan and structure work? Right now I would like to schedule majority of travel in the next 3 months and then only go somewhere by train and when completely necessary. 
3) Any tips/advice on returning to work and how to organise that?

81,"So with my first pregnancy I had pre-eclampsia that started around my 36th week. Luckily, it never got terribly bad. Somehow by the fates, I went into labor the night before I was scheduled to be induced and labor and delivery went smoothly. I delivered a little past 37 weeks, and I truly believe the pre-eclampsia stunted her growth because she barely came out 5 pounds.  She's 18 months now and we plan to start ttc when she turns 2ish. Research says that pre-eclampsia is a first pregnancy thing and I don't have a high percentage of getting it again, but looking at other forums tells me otherwise.

I've been working for the same company for a long time, and I'm long overdue to get a promotion. I also really have to focus on my career, as my partner is going to be a stay-at-home parent after our child is born. I'm about 4 months pregnant, and I've applied for a promotion at work. I expected to have the interviews this month, though, I just found out today that the posting has been pulled, will be re-issued next month and everyone can re-apply then. Which means that I will be 5 or 6 or even 7 months pregnant by the time the interviews happen, and my plan of wearing my pre-pregnancy interview clothes is now out the window. We also can have up to 4 interviews, and while everyone in the company wears casual clothes for day-to-day we're expected to dress professional for the interviews. Which means 4 new professional outfits that I will wear exactly once. Also, while my manager has assured me that they will not take into account my pregnancy and the fact that I will be out for three months shortly after starting, that's a lot easier to believe when they can't tell during the interview.

So, I'm pretty pissed about this sudden change. Any suggestions? One of my coworkers suggested I go to HR, but I'm not sure what they're going to do. Demand that my interviews suddenly happen tomorrow? I'm not sure if that would work out great if they could.

At this point we strongly believe it‚Äôs a boy and I have even bought a couple outfits for him. It seems silly to not confirm after these incidents, since my nesting is in full swing and I can fully prepare for baby once I know. Part of me is reluctant to since I always wanted that ‚Äúsurprise! It‚Äôs a blank!‚Äù in the hospital and I would be robbing myself of a serious surprise if it did somehow happen to be a girl. 

Would you just find out at this point if you were me? And how can I go about doing so? I‚Äôm assuming if I call my OB they will be able to pull up my charts and tell me?

101,"So recently, my husband and I got our NIPT results back, and our baby tested high risk for monosomy X, aka Turner syndrome.  We‚Äôve been truly devastated, but after meeting with a phenomenal genetic counselor, have a little more hope for it being a false positive.

The other day I had a nuchal translucency scan done, which showed a normal sized nuchal fold and a healthy baby. However, that‚Äôs not 100% accurate and could still mean our baby girl will have turners.

Next step is to have amniocentesis done on January 9th. I‚Äôm extremely nervous about this but I want to do whatever it takes to make sure my child is ok.

My question is, have any moms here had amniocentesis done? Is it really painful/uncomfortable? What symptoms can I expect during the following 24 hours? Any tips/advice?

We got to the hospital at 3:30 on Sunday to start our induction due to high blood pressure. As soon as I got in I was told to pee in a cup and put on the dreaded labor gown. I thought I might escape being immediately half naked but no such luck. They had to hook me up to all the monitors and a blood pressure cuff. I also had to have an IV placed which made me nauseous and shaky. They had to try a couple of times and collapsed a vein in the process. I told my husband to sit as he began looking extremely pale. 

The nurse was very nice. She asked if I had a birth plan and I told her my only plan was for me and baby to be healthy and if possible to avoid narcotics as they make me EXTREMELY LOOPY. Claritin D makes me hallucinate so I really didn‚Äôt think I could have anything stronger. She laughed and wrote it down. She was also careful to take every latex product out of the room as I‚Äôm allergic and she didn‚Äôt want anyone accidentally using them. The doctor eventually came in, checked me, and said I was ‚Äúat a good 1cm.‚Äù He then inserted the cytotec pill and said they would give the pills orally every four hours and see how I was doing in the morning. 

My mom and aunt came by, brought us dinner and tried to make the time pass quickly. My mom was also a bro and grabbed me a milkshake right at 11 before I got cut off from food at midnight. Sleeping was absolutely miserable. I kept having to pee which meant my husband would get up every few minutes, unplug all  the monitors, I‚Äôd use the bathroom, then waddle back and have to be hooked back up. The nurses came in about every 45 minutes to get Leo back on the monitor as he kept wiggling away from it. They remarked that they could clearly feel him wiggle and move but has more trouble than usual keeping him on the monitors. 

By the morning I felt like absolute crap due to lack of sleep and being stuck in uncomfortable positions . They let me take a shower which I gladly accepted to wash all the monitor jelly off of my tummy. Much to my delight my doctor also let me eat breakfast. My aunt ran out and grabbed me Chick-fil-A since I despise hospital food. Afterwards I tried to nap on and off, mostly unsuccessfully. By the fourth or fifth round of cytotec the doctor felt that breaking my waters would not only help with progression but would allow them to place an internal contraction monitor since the other monitor wasn‚Äôt working well. He wanted to have a better idea of my contractions before he started the pitocin. The actual breaking of the waters didn‚Äôt hurt at all although he apologized profusely through it. I told him that I was far more traumatized by the IV than cervical check or anything. 

After that my contractions really ramped up. The pitocin was started at this point as well.  I was handling them just fine until back labor set in. I went from gladly talking through contractions to having to breathe through them and demanding my husband to rub my back. The nurse said it could take as long as an hour from the time I decided on an epidural for them to get there so I said ‚ÄúYEP IM READY.‚Äù She wanted to know if I was sure because I had been taking it so well until the last fifteen minutes or so. The answer was a shameless yes. I told her I was pretty sure that he was face up based on that back labor but nothing came of my suggestion. (I actually mentioned this to several more people over the course of the day but no one paid it any mind.) The anesthesiologist was in within 20 minutes and I‚Äôve never been more relieved to see someone. Everyone but my husband got kicked out while they performed the procedure. Luckily the contractions I got through it were fairly bearable.
I know epidurals aren‚Äôt supposed to make you high but I swear I felt a little high as it started to take affect. My mom and aunt were let back in the room and they agreed that I looked out of it. Luckily this allowed me to actually get some sleep despite being soaked in amniotic fluid and hooked up to awkward machines. Unluckily my blood pressure got too LOW every time I got into a deep sleep. I was able to get just enough sleep I didn‚Äôt feel quite so dead before giving up because I kept setting off alarms. I got to sit up for a while and do some crosswords. It was nice after being stuck on my back for so long. 

At the next check I was 4cm! Unfortunately Leo started having heart decelerations with the contractions. I got put on my side again and given oxygen. They watched him closely for a few minutes but the decelerations didn‚Äôt stop. They turned off the pitocin for a while and he seemed to respond well. I still contracted fairly consistently. The nurse warned me that she did see these kinds of situations turn into emergency c-sections. She felt this was even more likely considering my husband and I were both 9lbs and emergency deliveries. 

Once they deemed him stable they turned the pitocin back on. He did well this time so I continued to labor on. This is the period of time that seemed to drag on for forever. We listened to some music.  My husband kept rolling his chair around the room like a psycho instead standing up which made me laugh so hard I was snorting. Mostly we were all bored out if our minds. About the time my aunt was going to run get them dinner I was checked and told I was 7cms. She was afraid to leave so instead grabbed them some vending machine snacks.

7cm to 10cm seemed to go pretty quickly. It was about 6pm when I was told I could start some practice pushes. The doctor was there for them incase I progressed really quickly. I got frustrated with pushing almost immediately. I couldn‚Äôt feel where to push very well through the epidural. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt hold my breath to the count of 10, take a quick breath and keep going. I was having to take a quick breath in the middle of pushing which the nurses told me not to do. I told them I couldn‚Äôt breathe so I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly how to fix that. (I think I phrased it more kindly but I was super overtired at that point soooo ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.) My main nurse at the time grabbed me the oxygen and that helped some. The doctor kept saying that he felt I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt really going for it‚Äù and to ‚Äútry harder.‚Äù I‚Äôm a perfectionist and extremely athletic. Every time he said these things I wanted nothing more than to beat the crap out of him. I was also starting to get really upset because I felt I should have been automatically good at pushing. 

After a while of unproductive pushing the doctor had to go work with some of the other patients. (Three of us were in labor at once and he was the only doctor there.) I had anywhere from two to eight nurses at one time working with me. We did the tug of war rope that helped a little bit. Somewhere in there we discovered I was right and the baby was totally sunny side up. This meant he was pretty much caught under my pelvic bone, not that I was bad at pushing. Over the course of the next hour and a half my epidural wore off and I let it so I could feel what the heck it was I was doing. They then had me flip to hands and knees, on my side, etc. to try and get him uncaught and moving on. The nurses were impressed I could move myself considering my legs were still all funky from the epidural. I was basically heaving my whole body weight with my arms. 

This is where things got really shitty. The doctor came in briefly but decided that the lady next door was going to deliver first. By 7:20ish we could see his head. They let me see with the mirror which was both awesome and awful because I was so far away from having him out. The nurses went to go get the doctor but he was in the middle of delivering the other baby. He said for me to breathe through the contractions and labor down. That. Fucking. Sucked. At this point my epidural was GONE. Every fiber in my being wanted to push. With every contraction I had to breathe, close my eyes, and use my arms to push on the bed bars so I didn‚Äôt push with the contractions. His head was literally RIGHT THERE but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to push. During this time the nurses went to town with mineral oil and massaging down there. Looking back everyone was really trying to keep me from tearing but at the time I hated everyone, especially my doctor. My nurse kept trying to say laboring down would help prevent tearing but I was beyond reason at that point.

I kept going into myself if that makes sense. I would close my eyes and try to pretend I didn‚Äôt exist. The nurses kept trying to engage me in conversations. I knew they were trying to help but I desperately wanted them to shut up. Luckily my husbands answered their questions for me and they stopped after a while. My main nurse at this point was an angel named Lillian. She kept sending techs running and telling the doctor he needed to get his ass in there. At about 7:45 she let me push with the occasional contraction. Eventually I think she could tell I had reached my limit and if I wasn‚Äôt allowed to push one of my family members was going to riot. She said something to the effect of ‚Äúwell, doctor had his chance to get in here.‚Äú

So at 7:50 ish she let me push. It hurt like a bitch but was SO MUCH BETTER than laboring down. Lillian had the tech and my mom start rubbing my toes because apparently that makes contractions stronger? At this point I was out of my mind and felt super out of control. My husband kept giving me oxygen/holding the oxygen in front of my face so I could breathe it without it touching me. I didn‚Äôt want my contractions to be any stronger and wanted to tell them to stop but couldn‚Äôt. I think Lillian was just trying to get him uncaught from my pelvis but it was awful. It took me weeks to be okay with anything or anyone touching my toes. 

Everything started to become a blur. I began pushing like a mad woman. I was grunting and groaning with every push. Lillian used some sort of numbing stuff because it was a certainty that I was going to tear. I became vaguely aware that the doctor had come in. Any reason I had was gone. I started screaming ‚ÄúI WANT HIM OUT!‚Äù Like an absolute psycho. I kept almost getting him out only for him to slip back ok. My pushing became desperate and crazed. I‚Äôm not sure if I was even pushing with contractions at that point. My doctor wasn‚Äôt in the room but for maybe five minutes before Leo was born.

I had been afraid Leo‚Äôs shoulders would be awful considering all the trouble getting his head out but the second his head was out the rest of him pretty much slid out no problem. He was born at 8:11pm on September 24th. The second he was out it was like I had never been in pain. He was plopped right on my chest and god I had never seen anything more perfect. I just kept staring at his little finger and ears. The nurses had to suction out his mouth because he was super gurgle-y. The placenta delivery was no big thing. My doctor asked if I wanted to see it and I responded ‚ÄúUh I think I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Apparently I get sassy with no sleep and hours of labor üòÖ. I had a second to third degree tear. I felt some of the stitches but I didn‚Äôt really mention it. It hurt so much less than everything else had and I had a baby to look at so I didn‚Äôt really care at that point.

My hospital did the golden hour as part of their standard procedure. It was pretty amazing. I let him breastfeed for a while before letting in my dad, brother, and best friend. We then just all chilled out in the room for a while and admired little man. Eventually we sent my dad for Krystal‚Äôs which ended up being the best thing I‚Äôd ever eaten. 

(He‚Äôs 12 weeks now but I wrote this out a whille back) He‚Äôs almost three weeks old now! Those two nights at the hospital were some of the hardest in my life. He REFUSED to sleep in the bassinet so my husband and I had to sleep in shifts. I also have fairly flat nipples so breastfeeding was shitty until one of the magical nursery nurses brought me a nipple shield and showed me how to use it. Life is just now starting to get into a normal rhythm. Leo is very much a Velcro baby and must be held at all times. He will  tolerate sitting in his boppy lounger next to me. We ended up bedsharing by week two because sleeping in shifts wasn‚Äôt going to work once my husband had to return to his job. 10/10 would recommend. We still have rough nights but overall much much better. I had some really hard nights as far as baby blues and anxiety went but I turned a corner right after week two. PP is harder than I expected but that a post all of its own. Overall I‚Äôm so in love with this tiny human I‚Äôm already trying to convince my husband that Leo needs a sibling.

103,"I‚Äôm 22 weeks, 31 years old and this is our first. I know being a woman is already hard and you‚Äôre constantly wearing defensive armor...and then I became pregnant. Boy, do people feel so entitled to validation through your experience. I‚Äôm talking down to strangers, sales associates, cashiers etc. It‚Äôs to the point where I laugh now when I get unsolicited comments because I‚Äôm realizing how specific ideas and language are just ingrained in (Western) pregnant culture. Whether it‚Äôs being told you‚Äôre so ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúhuge‚Äù and you‚Äôre ‚Äúabout to pop,‚Äù being scoffed at for wanting a natural birth or alternative plan to a hospital birth or vice versa etc. I‚Äôve also felt so condescended to- sadly by older women or moms with multiple kids, who seem to think because they‚Äôve had kids before and I haven‚Äôt I must be a total moron, not in the know like them. 

But outside of the unsolicited advice, arbitrary reasoning behind gender guesses, and loaded language with which people carelessly talk to you, I think my biggest one has been ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre just full of pregnancy hormones,‚Äù which comes across as very dismissive. Yes, there are hormones and maybe the reactions and feelings to things are a bit stronger but I‚Äôve gotten the impression it‚Äôs said to me in a way that‚Äôs akin to ‚Äúoh, it must be that time of the month‚Äù where suddenly any capacity for logical, rational thought is just not on the table anymore and I‚Äôve felt helplessly reduced to this antiquated idea of what a pregnant woman is.

120,"Hi everyone! I can‚Äôt believe it has already been 12 days since I delivered my little girl. I also can‚Äôt believe I almost didn‚Äôt go get checked out. I‚Äôm not a great story teller. 

On December 4th, I clocked into work at 8:30 and got onto the elevator. Suddenly I felt a small gush of fluid. I went to the restroom and saw just a small spot (about the size of a penny) in my underwear. I honestly thought I had peed a little. When I wiped, I also noticed some of my mucus plug. I know you can slowly lose your mucus plug and that it doesn‚Äôt mean immediate labor so I played it off and continued with work. 

I could not shake the feeling that something was wrong. I ended up calling my OB‚Äôs nurse hotline and told her the story. She suggested I go get swabbed for amniotic fluid. The issue is I work one hour in the opposite direction of the hospital where my OB is (I commute to work). So I told my boss and called my husband and made the hour commute to the hospital. 

I get to the hospital around 2 pm and even told the L&amp;D triage nurse that I‚Äôm certain it was just pee because I felt crazy for going through all this. Well, ten minutes later she comes back and tells me that my water had broken and it ‚Äúlooks like your having a baby today.‚Äù I broke down crying because I was alone and this was the last thing I expected. I had not slept or eaten in forever. I had no bag packed. Nothing. They checked me and I was 3 cm. I had not had my 36 week appointment yet to check for dilation, group B, and the ultrasound. 

They put me into the delivery room and start a fluid bolus and pitocin. They told me to tell them when I wanted an epidural an hour before I thought I would need it to give the anesthesiologist on call time to get to the hospital. Now it is 7pm and the pitocin is making me miserable. I‚Äôm vomiting, shaking, and hurting. I tell the nurse I‚Äôm ready for the epidural. 

THREE HOURS LATER the anesthesiologist shows up. It is now 11pm and they want me to rest a couple of hours since I‚Äôm not at 10 cm‚Äôs yet. I sleep from 11pm-1am. 

At 1am they check me and I‚Äôm at 10 cm with contractions close. I start pushing at 1:15. 

I pushed from 1:15 to 4:36 am. They entire time I‚Äôm shaking from the pitocin and vomiting between pushes. It was miserable. The worst part is the downtime between contractions and pushing because the pressure is so intense and you can‚Äôt do anything but breathe through it. 

After all this my little Claire was born at 4:36 am on Dec 5th, 36 weeks and 1 day, 6lbs 10 oz‚Äôs, 19.5 inches long. I had a stage 2 episiotomy. 

They take my Foley out and move me into a postpartum room. Around 11 am, I still haven‚Äôt peed so they bladder scan me and I had 1L in my bladder. They had to put a foley in which was honestly the worst part of it all. I‚Äôm swollen with not pain meds and stitches and they have to spread me and restick a catheter in there. Just thinking about it gives me chills.

I've also been doing a daily sinus rinse to rinse the green goop out and I use massage on my face pressure points to help break everything up but I'm still completely miserable. 

I don't know what the point of this post is since none of you are my doctors and can give me medical advice, I just need to vent I guess. It sucks being so sick and not being able to take anything to help clear it up!",Nearly 37 weeks and so so so sick,1
124,"*throwaway alert*

I‚Äôd love some opinions on my current situation. I will most likely be having a c-section due the positioning of the baby; my doctor would like this to happen at 39 weeks (nothing wrong with me or baby, just want to prevent me going into labor beforehand) 

39 weeks would be 1/3/19. However, if I can have the c section 3 days earlier on 12/31, I would save well over $7k on insurance and taxes costs. For personal reasons, I would much prefer a 2018 baby. We had several losses that all would have been due in 2018. This way, we would still be getting our baby in 2018. This is not something I take lightly as my mental health has been in a rough place the whole third trimester. 

My doctor seems reluctant to do a c section at 38+4, but I haven‚Äôt pushed too hard. Should I keep pushing? Or just accept the 1/3 date?  ",C section at 38+4?,1

131,"Bare with me because this is my first time posting on this sub. I don‚Äôt know where to start with this post so be prepared for some rambling and I‚Äôm sorry for the length. 

My husband and I are both 24, healthy, and expecting our first child in just a couple weeks (due December 29th). We elected to have an early ultrasound to see if the sex of our baby could be determined, we were told it‚Äôs a girl :). At our anatomy scan, the ultrasound tech was having trouble visualizing the baby‚Äôs bladder so we scheduled a follow up ultrasound a few weekends later (we were told this can be pretty common as the baby may had just emptied the bladder). They were still having some issues at the follow up scan and we were referred to an mfm in the area. 

It took 2 appointments with the mfm but the specialist seemed quite confident that nothing was wrong as my amniotic fluid levels were good, baby‚Äôs kidneys weren‚Äôt dilated. They did visualize the bladder but just thought it was on the small side. We left that appointment feeling relieved since the doctor was quite confident there was no
Bladder exstrophy. 

My husband and I moved out of state and I had to find a new OB at around 30 weeks. Everything was great, I actually really like my new doctor way more than the one I was seeing before. We had an additional scan at 32 weeks because my doctor wanted to have an anatomy scan of their own and he was not convinced that the bladder is normal. He referred me to a specialist in my new town. This new doctor seemed much more in depth about looking at all the signs of bladder exstrophy (ambiguous genitalia, low chord insertion, abnormal abdominal wall,location of the bladder) and she looked for things that the other specialist didn‚Äôt. Problem is, I‚Äôm so far along now that it was really difficult for them to get a really good look at all these things! She seems to think there‚Äôs a good chance our baby has bladder exstrophy. 

I didn‚Äôt realize the severity of this complex disease until she pulled out articles showing babies with this condition. Also, she recommended we do a panorama test to confirm that the baby is truly a girl (bladder exstrophy can cause male scrotum to appear as labia because it is split in half). I took the blood test in the hopes (1.) that we would be assured it‚Äôs a girl and if that‚Äôs the case, even if she has this condition, it‚Äôs probably a milder case or (2.) we find out its a boy and are prepared that the baby certainly has bladder exstrophy. Either way I was ready for some sort of answer. 

My results took the full two weeks to come in and when I get an email saying the report is in I check it immediately. The results were inconclusive. Apparently this can happen sometimes but I cried because any sort of answer is what I needed at the moment. 

My OB discussed informed me at my appointment last week that it would be better for him to deliver us at a different hospital that has a better NICU and staff better equipped for the worst case scenario.  The hospital is literally less than 3 miles away than our original hospital but I can‚Äôt help but stress for several reasons. First, we had a scheduled induction scheduled for the 27th because I really wanted to deliver before the new year (I have already paid over a grand for all these extra visits and ultrasounds and deductible will start over). Also, hubby and I have never been to this new hospital and we got used to our original hospital since my weekly appointments are there we took our prenatal classes there. 

I am really hoping that our doctors are just trying to be as cautious as they can since they can‚Äôt determine anything for sure until birth. Part of me thinks they have to be wrong because bladder exstrophy only happens in about 1/40,000 babies. I know this isn‚Äôt rational thinking since they were the ones with all this training but many doctors have never even seen this condition let alone diagnose it before birth. I know this is naive of me to think but I can‚Äôt help but hope this is the case. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure what I am trying to gain from posting this other than getting everything off my chest to strangers because it is really hard trying to explain everything to family when we have no real answers ourselves. They are awesome and have a right to be kept in the loop but it is exhausting trying to explain everything to them. 

Hope all you other mommas are doing great and having a boring pregnancy, thanks for letting me air everything out.

132,"So the other night I experienced what I could only call a 'glitch in the matrix'. I currently sleep in what will be the babies room as I am rolling around the entire bed all night trying to get comfortable, it's right near my daughters room with only the family bathroom and laundry separating the rooms so I know if she gets up during the night.


I woke thinking I heard her open the door between the hallway and our main living area, so I checked the monitor and there she was fast asleep in her bed. Weird. I checked the time and it was 4.15am. I rolled from my left to my right side and went back to sleep.... Only to be woken (in the exact position I fell asleep in) by my husband entering the room holding our toddler saying 'she was asking for you, I think she came in but couldn't wake you so came to me' (other side of the house). I was confused but just said ok and took her back to bed and got her back to sleep. But before I left the room I checked the time and it was 4.10am.... what? I was so confused I lay awake for hours trying to figure it out.




Last night I woke needing to pee. I lay there debating whether I should hold and go back to sleep or just get up. I decided to get up, I went and peed then decided to have a drink at the sink using my toddlers cup.... Only to notice my feet were not touching the floor. Weird. I extended my toes and the tips of my big toes hit the floor. I was hovering in mid air. Oooooook. I experimented by going up, down and corkscrewing, all in mid air. I MUST be dreaming! I floated back to the room and just for shits and giggles floated to the ceiling, which felt cool against my back, before floating back to bed, getting comfortable and going back to sleep. Only to wake in the exact position I fell asleep in (needing to pee). This time I knew what had happened and was not so weirded out by it.

133,"Okay guys I‚Äôm (23 female) on here because I‚Äôm nervous about my pregnancy.

134,"FTM, 10 days past due. We have spent the entire pregnancy planning for a homebirth. We have a wonderful midwife and I have a very supportive and excited husband. Today we went in for an ultrasound today to discover that baby is (frank) breech position. Most midwives in Canada will not deliver a breech baby at home.

I've now spent 10 months imagining, prepping for, and telling everyone that will listen to me about, my natural homebirth and this afternoon, in less than 5 minutes with the tech, I found out I will likely need a c-section. 

I am beyond crushed. It has nothing to do with how negative people can be about c-sections. Instead, it has everything to do with why I wanted a natural homebirth in the first place. I have a real fear of hospitals. I soo wanted to do this at home. I wanted to be in a calm and familiar setting. I wanted to have complete control of all of the factors that I could have, a side from the actual birth because only baby can control that üòâ. I wanted to be able to control who would attend the birth... now I'll be surrounded by strangers and a sterile, foreign environment. Doctors also freak me out in general, which is why I elected to have a midwife. I have been praising and defending our choices for 10 months and all of a sudden, all that I had hope for the birth is seemingly impossible. 

I realize that all that matters is that I do what's best for baby. And believe me, that is all that matters right now. I want to deliver a healthy, beautiful, baby. And asap. But, I'm still very much heartbroken. I don't want to tell anyone else right now. So many people advised against us having a homebirth that I just don't want to answer anyone's questions right now (obviously a breech baby could have happened even if I had been planning on a hospital birth from the get go).

135,"I have my biweekly appointments phasing into weekly appointments as of my next visit this week. 

My boy has always been somewhat active, and my doctor has mentioned that feeling very little movement is common this far along due to the fact that he's getting a little cramped in there. 

But the doctor also has made it very clear that if I feel less than 10 movements in a 2 hour timeframe that I should be calling the maternity ward and go to the emergency department. She didn't give me a reason, and never gives me the chance to ask any of my burning questions. 

I'm worried, but at this point don't have the energy to walk myself to the hospital every time the count doesn't add up. 

I thought maybe my size and height would be a factor, because I'm about 6 feet tall, and a little overweight, but I really am going in blind here. 

Is it expected to have MUCH LESS movement this far along? The heartbeat has always been healthy when given the doppler, but the mystery and lack of explanation on my doctor's orders is really starting to make me scared for my baby. 

TLDR: I don't feel much movement from my baby, and my doctor told me to count out 10 movements within a 2 hour timeframe. I never add up to 10 per 2 hours, and I do not have access to the hospital outside of appointments to visit the ER every time this happens. Is this normal?

We were staying with my in laws while we closed on our house and she was our first so no little ones to watch. This time we have a 3 year old and are in our own house. So just laying still will not be an option. So my worry is that if it's as bad as last time I may actually end up in the hospital.

Has anyone had it the first time and not the second? 

I'm trying to think ahead in case I have it and these are the two options I thought of please feel free to critique/offer another idea.

1 - my three year old is currently in preschool three mornings a week, I could switch it to 5 day all day (an extra $265 a month) and I would have my husband home when she is, theoretically it would only be for a month or so but it might be kind of a shock for her.

2- she goes to preschool mon/wed/Fri mornings and then usually comes home finishes her lunch and then naps until about 3:30. So maybe I could pay someone to come over on tue/Thurs to watch her and clean up. This option would probably cost more. And I'm a people pleaser to with social  anxiety so I would feel weird about someone in my house even if I needed it.

141,"Hi guys,

I'm a FTM and I'm only 9+3 but I really just need a vent I guess. Since week 6 I have been battling the most intense nausea I have ever experienced. I constantly feel like I am right on the edge of throwing up *all the time* and sometimes I do. It got so bad after a week when I lost 4lbs that I ended up at the doctor who did a few tests and prescribed me cyclizine because I was so dehydrated and couldn't eat anything. It helped take the edge off for a while but I've still ended up missing a significant amount of work and feeling like crap. The last few days have been really tough and I feel like it's just totally overridden the meds. I'm spending days in a row in bed unable to do much except eat biscuits. I'm back off to the doctor later but I feel like a total let down. If I can't handle this nausea then how am I going to handle any other symptoms down the line? I had my first scan a couple of days ago which was one of the most incredible moments in my life, seeing the wee heartbeat flickering away. I just wish I didn't feel so rotten. I feel like a burden on my husband, I feel like I'm being stupid or needy, I feel like the doctors must think I'm just a wuss. So many women have it way worse than me and manage to go to work and get on with their lives. I feel a bit like I'm being ungrateful.

I don't know. It's probably all the hormones but I just feel so... horrible at the moment. I am so excited about my little Skittle but I just wish I didn't feel so useless and sick all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my last post my wife and I have been doing several things that we figured might help her through this rough time. The first couple weeks she refused to work and basically sat at home all day. In her defense, she didn't flat out refuse to work, she asked for reduced hours and her boss said you either work full hours or none at all, to which she called in sick. After a few weeks her and her boss were able to sort things out and she's now back to working 3 days a week. It's better than nothing and it's better than her being at home every day, being so isolated and alone also made her very sad. 

She's eating again, she's gained 5 kilograms and she looks a lot better in general. Her anemia is better, she's been on iron supplements and she doesn't look like a ghost anymore. She went to the doc to get her throat checked out and there's nothing of concern, it was infected with a virus and it caused major swelling but it went away after three full weeks of pain. The blood and mucus she was coughing up came from her nose, it was a post-nasal drip that she got after her throat surgery. The surgeon said that the post-nasal drip is something that can last for years, or even be chronic, basically because her surgery was butchered. Well she was pretty pissed about that. 

She also said that she doesn't want to be a mother and never wanted children, which is the major contributor to her depression, but she's learning to cope with both those issues. We've been to the hospital and they have enlisted her in a special treatment plan which involves a psychiatrist that is specialised in prenatal and post partum depressions. 

We also switched midwifes, my wife was more comfortable to have a midwife at the hospital rather than one that was a third party. She also got a medical indiction that she needs to have her baby in the hospital. She can't give birth at home and that's something she really wanted, but she's come to terms with the fact that we will be in the hospital for the birth.

She still smokes, and she still consumes (too much) caffe√Øne. But, so far on all check-ups our little girl is growing properly and has no issues. On all the ultrasounds we were complimented on her health, her organs look very healthy, and one woman even said she had the prettiest heart that she'd ever seen on an ultrasound (really, she kept looking for 10 minutes just how the four chambers were moving around). Her kidneys, lungs, bones and muscles are all also developing properly and there's no reason to think that she's not healthy. We've done the tests on the chromosomes, it came back clean and there's no chance that she has down-syndrome or one of those other spooky diseases you hear about. 

So far, it seems like we're getting a little health girl despite my wife's efforts to ruin her pregnancy. (I don't know if that was her end goal, it just seems like it was if you consider the fact that she doesn't want to be a mother). This little girl is a fighter and basically already telling her mom that there's no stopping her. I'm already proud of my little girl before she's even born. 

There's no more talk about suicide coming from my wife, which is a relief, and I'm also no longer afraid that she's a danger to others around her. Her driving is better and she doesn't fall asleep during the day anymore. Her sleeping is still very disrupted, she wakes up 4-5 times a night and then goes back to sleep again. Usually, between 6 and 10 am she will get up depending on if she can fall asleep again or not. If she's working, she goes to bed at 11PM and if she's not working she goes to bed around 12-1AM. 

Right now she's having trouble (sorry for all FTM's, this is a real issue) feeling when she needs to go to the bathroom for a number 2. That, combined with the fact that her stomach isn't really optimal either (diarrhea), causes her to need ""emergency"" showers quite a lot. She's a bit annoyed by this but luckily she's not embarassed or too scared to share her struggles with me, she even laughs it off and jokes about it quite often. I feel sad for her that this pregnancy literally causes her to poop her pants, I mean no adult should really have to go through that, but on the other hand it's a common side effect of pregnany and shit happens, literally. We make sure we just clean her up the best we can and obviously if she needs my help I will help her, most of the time she does clean herself and her clothes and I just clean where-ever she sat on when it happened. But she's been a really good sport about the whole ordeal and it doesn't seem to bother her much. Just one of the things that comes with pregnancy. 

The last thing I wanted to share with you is that she did self-harm after we got into a fight. Basically she kicked me out for  a night because I had been rude to her, and she was so upset that she had tore the skin of her arm in two different places. She hadn't self-harmed for probably years before this happened and I think this was because of the depression that she now did this. I told her that I wasn't mad at her but that I really wanted her to try and stop doing it again, this time for good. She agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for being here with me and helping me with my wife, it's been a tough time for both of us and we will continue to work on it, I hope that once the baby is out that she will feel happy and like her old self again. I will obviously post updates when our little girl is born.

I just looked at cribs, and they‚Äôre much bigger than I thought! In the nursery, I could fit the crib and then either a rocker or changing table, but I have doubts about squeezing in all 3. Does the following make sense?

Just get an awesome pack and play and initially put it next to my bed. Then I can use that bassinet and changing tray that are on top. Rocker in nursery? When hanging out downstairs, bassinet has handle and can be brought down, or I got a free baby box that we can leave downstairs. Buy a separate changing table for spacious living room downstairs.

When baby grows out of bassinet, move pack and play to nursery and use that AS the crib?? Then when I move to a bigger house, get a real crib? For the rare travel, would pack up that pack and play.

155,"This is gonna probably be crazy long, because wow what a wild ride labor was with my daughter. There is some crazy stuff that happened, I don‚Äôt know if it might trigger someone but if you read this and believe so please let me know and I‚Äôll update the flair!

My daughter was due December 13th, on December 12th my husband and I headed to L&amp;D for my scheduled induction. I was very adamant about being induced, but I knew it was time for her to come and meet everyone. 

I got there around 7:15 PM, and at 9:20 my nurse (I can‚Äôt remember the medication name) stuck a little pill in my cervix to help jump start labor. Within an hour I was feeling cramping, but it wasn‚Äôt unbearable. I wanted to see how long I could go without getting the epidural anyways. Over the next few hours, contractions got stronger and more close together. I ended up asking for the epidural around 3 in the morning. Once that kicked in, I was able to sleep for 45 minutes before my husbands stupid alarm started to go off. When I wake up, I‚Äôm starving. Feel like I‚Äôm gonna die from starvation. So I couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. 

Nurse comes in around 7 and checks me, I was about 3 cm dilated (when I was checked at the hospital I was at a 2, so I was like dang it). So she starts me on pitocin. At this point, I started to feel my contractions again, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. Stupid me. 

About 45 minutes later I tell her my epidural is wearing off, and I‚Äôm having full blown contractions at this point and I‚Äôm in a ton of pain and swearing like a sailor, lol. At this point as well I am having a lot of pain in my upper back and my neck, unbearable. She calls the anesthesiologist and he‚Äôs in the OR, and can‚Äôt make it up yet. I‚Äôm full fledged screaming at this point, especially at my husband who is watching that‚Äôs 70s show and not paying attention to me, lol. 30 minutes later my nurse shows up with the anesthesiologist and says ‚ÄúI pulled him out of the OR for you‚Äù I‚Äôm like thank god. He gives me another round of meds, and I finally chill out. I was around a 5-6 once it kicked in and she checked. That was at 9 AM. 

The nurse had me flipping on different sides of my body throughout being on the epi, and I was on my left side when I started to feel sick. My best friend grabs me a bag and I throw up a lot of liquid. Right after, my nurse and my OBGYN show up to break my water. My OBGYN goes to break it and says ‚Äúher water ruptured on her own, don‚Äôt know when but it could have broke when you got sick just now!‚Äù And after that everything is a blur. I remember pressure, lots of pressure every minute or so. My nurse said once the pressure stays to call her, not long after it was staying. I call her and she flips me over and I can feel my daughters head, I was fully dilated ready to go. 

They laid me flat on the bed and put my feet up to push. My OB has went back to her office for a minute to see a few patients so while she was doing that, I started pushing. And I can‚Äôt even explain how uncomfortable and in pain I was. They wanted me flat, with my chin to my chest and to hold my own legs when I was contracting. As stated earlier, my upper back and my neck hurt so bad, so I feel if I was in a different position, I wouldn‚Äôt have been pushing for 30 minutes but maybe 15-20. Eventually my dr comes back and has them adjust me, so I could push better and easier. 

Finally I was on my final push, so I start to push and feel her head come out. I‚Äôm screaming at this point, and my OB tells me to stop pushing, the cord is around her neck. She cuts it, and I finish pushing, and they put my daughter on my chest. She was blue and purple, and wasn‚Äôt crying. I was crying, why is my baby not crying!? Why is she blue and purple?! The nurses grab her immediately and take her to suction her out and she ended up having to get oxygen. A few minutes later I finally hear her crying, and I am sobbing. I was sobbing the entire time, I just wanted her to be okay. The nurse started patting her chest with some contraption, I‚Äôm assuming to get her blood flow going. Finally, after 30 agonizing minutes, my baby girl is returned to me.

I took a PT yesterday and I am pregnant with our second! Sooner than expected, but still very excited!  


For our first, I originally had a surprise planned for DH. However because of some early medical issues, I had to speed up the process, and told him pretty unceremoniously. I know he didn't mind how he found out, he was just excited for our daughter. This time around, I have a much simpler plan, except I am having trouble finding one component, and was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction?  


I bought a card where you can record your own greeting. It is blank, so you can add stuff to it to completely personalize it. My DH's and my first date was when the little theater in our town did a Chris Farley marathon four years ago. We both love Tommy Boy, so here was what I was thinking:  


On the front, I wanted to put [this image](https://ibb.co/W6fcrJm)  


And inside it would open up to [this](https://ibb.co/bQ6CqHD) (don't mind the hastily made mockup)  


I was going to wrap the test up for sanitation reasons, obviously. If it messes up the card working, then I would just take a picture of it with the results and put that in there instead.   


The problem I am running up against is that I need an image that will be 8.5 inches by 6 inches, and so far everything I have found has been too small and when I try to expand it, it gets really pixelated. Any suggestions where I can find larger versions of these stills?

158,"I had posted recently regarding my 3 year old nephew being in the hospital and wanted to update you and let you know where he's at. This will be long, so thanks for sticking with it. Talking about it helps get all the stress out of my head. Basically no one in my family has slept in a week. 


The neurologist read the MRI and he had a brain stem injury. They aren't exactly sure why it happened, but it has to do with his body dumping any and all potassium he had, so when they were pumping him full of fluids it rushed his brain in such a way that caused damage. I don't pretend like I understand or know what they mean here. His MRI showed white spots or bruising, and a possible stroke. 

They think it's possible he may have a previously undiagnosed mitochondrial disease or genetic condition that was exacerbated by the sickness he had at the beginning of the week. The neurologist did say the brain stem injury was a 1/1,000,000 fluke reaction to his dehydration and there was nothing she could have done to change what happened.

They have tested him for every infectious and viral disease they can think of  and have done a spinal with no answers. His tox screen came back absolutely normal. Aside from being acidotic (his bicarb had steadily been at 11, even with the fluids and medicine they had been giving him. ) but with his most recent draw had gone up to 15. It's supposed to be around 23. But it's an improvement. 

I went and visited him yesterday, and he has had some steady improvements. He is not just asleep all the time. The neurologist declared him in a coma at one point but thankfully he has become more aware and is responsive. 

He speaks as though he has had a stroke, managing some sentences, but a lot of garbled, unintelligible nonsense. He didn't recognize me as his aunt, and he doesn't recognize his sister. But he knows who his mom and dad are, and he really doesn't like the nurses, but who would like someone who gives them suppositories?


He has his sense of humor still, which is amazing. His mom was telling me how he has stinky breath cuz he can't brush his teeth currently and she went to kiss him and I told him to blow his stinky breathe in her face and he smiled, and did. She kissed him and then he asked for another kiss and when she leaned in he blew a bigger breathe in her face and kinda giggled.

He has a central line and an NG tube right noe and is seeing OT, PT, and Speech daily  to assess and help him.


And tomorrow the geneticist will come in and do a work up, but that will take a week to come back.


We've never been thru something like this and it's been terrifying. At first it was easy to point blame at what seemed like an obvious cause, but with all of his doctors being so unsure only time will give us answers as his results continue to trickle in.

My husband and I have been married for about a year and a half and I‚Äôll be 8 weeks pregnant this week. The pregnancy is a dream come true! We‚Äôve both always really wanted a family and we waited what felt like forever to be in a place to try to have a baby. We have cried so many happy tears and said so many prayers of gratitude for this baby. We already love him/her so much ‚Äî when I saw that sweet little heart beat for the first time, my entire life and perspective changed. I felt willing to move mountains to keep the sweet little bean healthy and happy. 

But the ‚Äúmorning‚Äù sickness has put a damper on my attitude. I guess I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this bad (1) because why do people have multiple kids if they have to endure this misery several times? and (2) neither my mother nor my MIL ever even vomited during their pregnancies. Luckily my OBGYN has prescribed me some nice medicine, but it‚Äôs still awful. I vomit every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Then there‚Äôs the constant bloating and gas pain and nausea and food aversions... it is so much. I‚Äôve never felt worse, physically or emotionally. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just these crazy hormones, but the morning sickness experience has taught me I had a sugar-coated view of pregnancy and motherhood. Now I‚Äôm terrified of everything I‚Äôve underestimated ‚Äî how hard is it going to be to give birth, learn to breastfeed, miss all my sleep for a newborn, and teach a baby to be a person for the next 18 years? Previously I thought all those things would be hard but bearable ‚Äî but I also thought morning sickness would be hard but bearable, and right now it feels pretty unbearable. I feel discouraged and like I maybe didn‚Äôt know what I was getting myself into üòÖ

TL;DR: I‚Äôm 8 weeks pregnant and it‚Äôs a dream come true. But ever since the sickness hit, I just feel terrified about all the discomfort I underestimated and like I am not prepared handle this whole pregnancy/birth/motherhood thing.

Anyway, my mom wanted to come stay from out of state and help with the baby after she is born. I totally expected this and am so grateful for that.

Or ‚Äúenjoy going to dinner now, because once that baby comes out, you won‚Äôt be going anywhere‚Äù

Most of the time I just smile and nod, however I get this strong urge to ask him if his experience with a newborn was so terrible, that he has nothing but negative things to say to us about our upcoming baby. Yes, babies cry, it‚Äôs how they communicate. And no we don‚Äôt plan to go out drinking. But seriously. It‚Äôs mainly him with the negative comments, and everyone else seems to be mostly positive about our new baby.

179,"Hey everyone,  I'm 14 weeks pregnant and happy with my current ob gyn. Best of all,  her office is three blocks from our apartment and the hospital she's associated with is two blocks away. She's in network. However,  a few weeks ago my husband and I learned that if we go with the provider and hospital affiliated with the university he works at (both are half an hour away by subway), our bills would be cut in half.  Thank God,  everything so far has been healthy and normal,  so this would likely mean our cost would go from 2k to 1k. If complications arise, the savings would be much more significant.

This is my first pregnancy,  so I'm not sure how much the convenience of a hospital a few blocks away is ""worth"". If you were in my situation,  what would you do? Luckily,  we can afford to pay for the convenience of the current provider, but obviously don't want to spend where it's not worth it.

181,"My husband and I are getting ready to start trying for a baby, and I couldn't be happier about it.

What's troubling to me is that I have struggled with persistent depression for about 15 years, and my episodes can become pretty severe. Right now I'm on Cymbalta (duloxetine) for my depression and migraines, and during my last appointment my doctor wanted me to come off of it for the pregnancy. It was rough to get on, and coming off has been HELL.

I've since decided to go see a different doctor in January (our insurance is changing and I want to take advantage of it), and go over options for antidepressants and other treatments. Right now, I'm not sure I can handle being off my meds for the pregnancy. I want to do what's best for my baby, and if my mental health ends up in the toilet that won't be good for either of us.

I'm terrified of Post-partum Depression, as keeping myself in a good headspace is a daily effort when my hormones are normal. 



I've been looking into alternative/natural treatments/remedies as well, which I'm going to bring up to the doctor, but I really think I'll need medication.

182,"I'll start by saying, I know I am extremely lucky to be given so much time to stay home and to get paid for it. I'm from the US originally but now live in Northern Europe where we get a ton of paid leave. I appreciate it but I still have different feelings about it and I'm struggling with both mom guilt and being mom shamed already. 

Daycares around here don't take babies until they are at least 12 months old and even then they may make you wait longer if there isn't a space in the daycare you chose. So one of us has to be home full-time until the baby is at least 1 maybe even longer. Private daycares before 12 months aren't an option as they don't exist and a nanny is rare and insanely expensive. 

My husband and I get 480 days to share between each other. He makes wayyy more money than I do so it makes more sense for me to be the one to stay home that year. So he'll pass some of his days over to me. People are shocked that he really only wants to keep the mandatory 90 days he has to take and that he won't be staying home for more time. He doesn't really want to stay home for 6 months straight and I honestly can't blame him for that. A lot of people take 3-4 days paid so they can stretch their leave out for longer and then one parent stays home 1-1.5 years then the other 6ish months. But that means a hit to the monthly income that we just can't take. 

The look of horror on others faces when I say I will be home a maximum of one year only if I can doesn't help either. I have had many conversations from others who are either pregnant or have kids on how 12 months is way to early to put him in daycare and that I should be home at least a year and a half. 

Thing is, I love working. I love being around adults and having adult conversations. I finally got a job in this country after moving abroad and I am feeling sad that I'll be losing that (my contract sucks so they don't legally have to keep the job for me to come back to and people are already eyeballing it so...it's gone). So after a year I'll be back at zero looking for a job again with sucky language skills for where I live. Which I'll be working to improve but it's not gonna be anywhere near what I need to work in my field after a year. Of course, if I do find a job earlier than a year that pays decently, my husband will stay home instead and I'll go to work. But that is a slim chance in my mind. It's looking more and more like I'll need to go back to school at some point. 

I know that for the first couple of months I will be glad to be home but the thought of being home for 12 months or more scares me. I am worried about boredom and not being the best mom I can be due to that. I know there are tons of mom groups around town but I'm worried about losing the ""adult"" time I have now at work. 

I'm just curious if anyone else had these thoughts. I feel guilty for thinking them sometimes as me being from the US, a lot of my other pregnant friends back home would kill to have even 12 weeks off and paid. 

But did anyone else not really love the idea of staying home? How did you manage it? Did you find you liked it in the end? Any tips or thoughts are appreciated! 

TLDR: Country, where we live, doesn't have childcare options until the child is 12 months or older. Someone has to be home full-time for at least a year and I am not sure I'm going to want to be home that long and I'm starting to worry about it.

Sorry as I'm sure many people have made similar posts to this...but I need some guidance. My husband and I recently got married in August, and have been together 5 years prior to that. We both have steady careers, bought our house over a year ago, and want nothing but success. I'm 26 and he's turning 28 at the end of the month.

&amp;#x200B;

We've always been on the fence on when we want to have kids but I feel like now more than ever...we feel like we're ready, the only thing holding us back is finances. Yes, we make a decent amount but 80% of our checks go towards bills...which has made us want to delay trying to conceive. We really want to start trying next month but we keep feeling iffy as we want to make sure we are a tad more stable financially.

My mom raised me as a single mother, and I harbor a lot of anxiety problems due to what I had to go through seeing her struggle. With the career I have, I know if I wait a little while longer we'd be set up way better financially...but i feel like when that day comes, I wont want to have kids due to all of the work responsibility.

I also started to feel queasy a few days after my period, but I was pretty sure it was due to stress at work.


Finally, at 18DPO, I picked up a pregnancy test on the way to work and took it, just to prove to myself that I was imagining things and that I wasn't pregnant--and I got a very faint positive.  I freaked out and called my husband.  He brought me another test, and it was positive too.  


I made an appointment with my doctor.  They tested my urine and the test came back negative.  I told the doctor I was having symptoms, and so he ordered a blood test just to be sure.

I live in a small area with realistically only 1 quality hospital within driving distance.   I delivered my first there.  Sadly they have a vbac ‚Äúban‚Äù in place.  However, a local woman had a successful vbac at that hospital a couple months ago for which her providers let her go past 40 weeks and she didn‚Äôt have an induction.  All three of these factors are huge for this hospital, because all are against their policies. 

I was able to reach out to her and found out which providers she used, so I will hopefully have good, supportive providers.  That‚Äôs where my support system ends.  My husband will only support me as far as the doctor‚Äôs recommendations extend.  During my first labor, he was upset with me for choosing to labor for 36 hours instead of getting a c-section at 6 hrs (no emergency present) like the midwife suggested.  He was just afraid and not in control of the situation, which was hard for him.   He is also woefully uneducated about birth/labor and resistant to my attempts to share information.  

Other family will also be unsupportive because everyone just wants the baby to be safe and for me to be alive.  And because my mom and mil both had c-sections for all their children, they all think major surgery is safer than letting the body do what it‚Äôs designed to do.   None of them are malicious, they just operate out of fear and ignorance (and like my husband don‚Äôt trust the info I share).

I have decided not to discuss my plans for a vbac with anyone other than my providers to save me the stress of defending my decision.  I‚Äôll talk to my husband about it at some point after I‚Äôve had plenty of time to get to know my providers and get on the same page with them.

We expected to try for four months and then go back in for more IUI, but instead got pregnant immediately. Don't assume anything*

When I talked to my OB about delivery options with this pregnancy she told me that normally they'd push for a vbac, but since she'd been there for my first delivery she would completely understand and support my decision if I just wanted to schedule a c section. I've done nothing but think about this for the last 12 weeks. I've discussed it with my husband, my counselor, my doctor, and my friend who is a doula and everyone has suggested scheduling a c section to reduce my stress levels (let's be honest, it's more like panic levels at this point).

211,"Get ready for a detailed report.
Around 9pm at 34w I went to the washroom and discovered I had lost a large amount of mucous plug. I called my MW who explained that it can regenerate and it doesn't mean I'll go into labour immediately. As long as there was leaking of waters or blood and baby was still meeting the kick counts without any cramping or pain, then I shouldn't worry. Cool. I go to bed, sleep perfectly fine. Wake up at around 6:30am on Nov 29th and oh look, more mucous. Still no other symptoms really just some slight cramping... I call the hotline and the MW says to take a hot bath, drink some water and relax and call back if the cramping is still going after an hour. So around 9:00-9:30 I finally give in and wake up my husband to tell him we're going to the hospital. I call the office to tell them I'm heading in because the cramping is increased and I'm having back pain as well. Now at this point I have tried to time the spasmic cramping/back pain but it goes from 30 sec breaks to 5 mins to 2 mins and there is no pattern to the cycle of pain. 
By the time hubby walks the dog and I pack a basic bag with the 5 things I know I'll need, toothbrush, deodorant, robe, change of clothes and slippers... I'm done and I need to be moving towards the hospital because it is really ramping up.
We get to the hospital but we haven't done a tour or dropped off my registration yet since I was sick for a few weeks and I'd didn't seem urgent.... Woops.
Then we go up to where I think I need to go... Nope wrong floor go down to number 4. 
We finally get into triage and the nurse comes in and hooks me up to monitors. I describe the cramping and back pain and tell her I'm not sure these are contractions because there's no rythm to it at all. Anyways we are left to wait for about a half hour. She comes back, asks me how I'm doing and I try to ask if I'm having contractions, because if I am wtf are they doing?!
So about an hour after I get into the assessment room I finally see a resident. They get me in a gown and she does a cervical check. ""Yep, you're 6cm dilated, you're having a baby today""
My instant reaction was ""nope. Nope. Nope. I'm only 34w. No way am I having a baby""
They move me up to a labouring room upstairs where I basically stretch out on the bed trying to push through the contractions. Then they amped up around 1pm and I asked if there was anything I could get to take the edge off. I got me some nitrous oxide. I don't think it was super effective but it did slightly dull the pain which was enough to get me by for a while. Around 8cm I had the ""oh shit maybe I want that epidural after all"" moment. They asked if I wanted it and I said I wasn't sure, I had hoped to get by without it. I'm not a fan of the possible side effects and I hate the idea of sticking a needle in my back. 
I asked for some insight on how long it would be before I started pushing. They said it could be fast or I could be stuck there for an hour or two before I progressed. 
Ok give me the epidural.
The anesthesiologist comes in, explains the risks and says I'll have to sit still on my side while they insert it. Yeah, sure because that's so easy. As soon as I turned to my side I knew it was too late.
""I need to push"" 
They checked and sure enough it's time to push. They wheel me to an OR since I'm preterm and there may be complications with the baby.
I pushed for about 45mins with baby bobbing in and out, then finally pushed her head and felt the instant relief of pressure. 
My baby girl Payton Lilly was born at 5lbs15oz kicking and screaming. She was rushed away immediately for assessment and taken to NICU before I got to really see her.

I sort of hate that I'm now one of ""those women"" with a birth story to scare new moms. Just know that HELLP is uncommon and it's good to be educated about the signs. Knowledge is power and you are your own best advocate. 

I created this new account for anonymity. HELLP is pretty rare but I still want to share my story. I knew nothing about it before my diagnosis. Frankly I didn't know much about pre-e either. I hope this can help someone else or at least make someone feel less foolish for calling the doctor. You'd rather feel silly calling in than wish you had. 

Some background- husband and I are both in our late 20s with no history of poor health. Also no history of preeclampsia on either side of our family. Now on to the story leading up to the birth. 

We got pregnant pretty easily after a few months and I was low risk from the get go. I had asked to do the 12 week genetic testing and the nurse at my OB sort of laughed since we were so low risk. All baby's testing came back normal and we knew we were having a girl. Around this time I had a high blood pressure reading and did a 24 hour urine test but this quickly resolved. All my readings were normal over the next few months. 

Around 25 weeks I started to get high readings again. I did extra blood work but everything was normal. We went on our babymoon and took the dreaded blood pressure cuff at my doctors direction. We didn't take it too seriously because at this point my readings were 120/80 range. 

I continued to be monitored but not in a worrying way as my pregnancy was still low risk. When we got closer to 30 weeks my blood pressure readings were closer to 130/90. This didn't worry us because it didn't seem like a big deal to have just a few points higher than average. I continued my daily blood pressure log, bringing it to my OB appointments. I just figured they were being abundantly cautious, which they were. Luckily for me. 

We traveled out of town around 30 weeks and brought the cuff again. Everything seemed to be fine but I started to get the occasional light headache. My readings were still pretty normal and never hit the call in numbers. 

At my 32 week appointment I had a blood pressure reading so high the tech thought the machine was broken. She retook it. My reading was around 180/100+. I saw the doctor immediately and got sent to triage for testing and more urine collection. 

At this point I was diagnosed with preeclampsia and informed I would be induced at 37 weeks. As you heavily pregnant ladies can understand, this came as a relief in a way. I still didn't understand the severity of preeclampsia, and I had a specific induction date at this point. So I was worried but also excited. My doctors kept me informed but they didn't want to scare me and tell me worse case scenario. It was reiterated to me to call in if I had symptoms like headaches or blurry vision, or with my call in blood pressure numbers. And to go straight to triage. 

With the preeclampsia diagnosis I was also informed that I needed steroid shots to develop baby's lungs in case she was early. This was just a precaution though. I stayed overnight in antepartum and got them. The IV placement was worse than the steroid shots. I never got the burning sensation other people talk about. Sure, they aren't fun and they do go in your butt cheek so be ready for that if you need them. But it's what is best for baby. 

I left antepartum in great health with good blood pressure readings. At 32+6 I woke up with a headache again and took my blood pressure reading. It was above call in numbers so we got ready to head to triage. My husband was as annoyed as I was driving back and forth at this point but we assumed we'd go home in a few hours. So we just brought our phone chargers to the hospital. 

I skipped the line at triage and saw my doctor who said my preeclampsia had gone from mild to severe. They informed me I'd be staying at the hospital and induced at 34 weeks. I did have every hope for a vaginal birth though I knew my risk of c section was higher. My bloodwork labs came back normal that morning. 

I was all ready to spend a relaxing (as much as it could be) week in antepartum at this point, just binging shows and enjoying the hospital bed and food menu. The nurses planned to take me on a NICU tour so I knew what to expect. I was also put on magnesium around this time. It wasn't fun, it makes you feel hot and weak. You also get no privacy as you can't be unsupervised when you get out of bed so bathroom trips need to be accompanied. 

Unfortunately I quickly went from feeling fine to feeling awful. I started to get a bad headache and my blood pressure readings creeped up. The nurses were having a harder time keeping it under control with medication. I soon experienced the most awful abdominal pain you could imagine. The nurses wrapped my hospital bed with towels up by my head in case I started seizing. This all happened in a matter of hours. I imagine the abdominal pain I had might be similar to a peak of a contraction that I didn't get a break from. I could not talk, text, or even process what was happening. At the worst point, I was completely at peace with dying. Before I was unable to speak I begged the nurses to knock me out. They didn't do that and I'm happy for that now. 

At this point I was experiencing class 1 (complete) HELLP syndrome. The hospital said they almost never see patients with HELLP detoriate so quickly. Thanks to my nurses' quick thinking, she had had labs run on me when I started experiencing abdominal pain. She suspected HELLP and she was correct. Before my labs came back she told me that when someone is in this much pain, they normally take the baby out as soon as possible. I was in acute liver failure and my platelets were drastically low. During HELLP syndrome your veins become extremely constricted so they had to call in a vascular specialist to ultrasound my arm to find a vein. Around this time my doctor came in the room and said they were taking us for an emergency stat c section as the baby needed to come now due to the severity of my HELLP case. 

From what I can remember it was like a scene from the movies, the doctors and nurses moving me very quickly down to the operating room. I finally felt pain relief when I was given the spinal. They don't like to give epidurals to patients with class 1 HELLP as there are risks including epidural hematoma. The spinal was fantastic though. I could've kissed my anesthesiologist, so I have that in common with other women that experienced pain relief during labor! 

What amazed me about the c section was how quickly the baby came out. My husband corroborates that, that it was only minutes from the start of surgery. From the time the doctor told me baby needed to come to when she was born, it was no more than 30 minutes. Right before the baby came out, I asked the anesthesiologist if she would cry. She didn't want to say yes, but she told me 27 weekers often cry. That's so incredible to think about. Also, many women report feeling tugging during surgery. I was on lots of extra medication that made me feel aloof and goofy, sort of like after getting your wisdom teeth out. I don't remember any tugging. I do recall thinking a c section was the easiest thing ever and why don't all women give birth like this (in my foolish state). I quickly learned why when the spinal wore off and I began recovery over the following weeks. 

Lucky for me my daughter came out crying and beautiful with a head full of hair. She was 4 pounds 5 ounces, measuring big for her age. My hospital normally allows skin to skin even after a C-section but as you can imagine that was not my case. Baby was taken to be with her NICU team, given oxygen and warmed up. After she was checked over and hooked up to monitors they brought her to me and my husband for a quick kiss. Then she was taken up to the NICU. I didn't see her until the next day. 

My husband and I talked about worse case scenario as I think many of us do, and he already knew he had my blessing to go with baby. Honestly, I was so drugged out of my mind I likely would not have known the difference if he was there. I don't remember being sewn up. My next memories are in recovery. After walking up with our daughter to level 3 NICU, he rejoined me in c section recovery. I had no idea it was that long looking back but he said we were there for hours. I do remember feeling very strange as my belly wasn't so big anymore and I couldn't feel my legs. 

Baby L and I both took a long time to recover. I spent a few days in the ICU while waiting for my platelet levels to rise again. I just managed to dodge a blood transfusion but at that point, I was so used to being poked, I did not care what was done anymore. There is nothing like the pain of HELLP syndrome, but having the tape taken off my incision was pretty awful. I  did get staples, which is rare now, due to my high risk of internal bleeding. It took a long time for my arms to heal, and by the end of my stay when nurses did labwork they had to call in nurse leaders to help them find veins. My body just had nothing left to give. At the beginning I did lab work at least 4 times a day, that went down to once a day by the time I left the hospital a week later. 

As much as I was poked and prodded, I survived. You will too. I was absolutely terrified of blood draws before I got pregnant. I had major white coat syndrome. But I did it. You can too. You can do anything for your baby. 

Leaving the hospital without your baby is awful. That was the worst part of the experience hands down. It is also not fun driving back to the hospital each day when you are recovering from a c section. The recovery was rough and after HELLP, I was informed my recovery was not standard. I wasn't allowed to walk for several days post op due to the medication I was on and my complications, so when I finally got up it felt like being stabbed with knives. I cannot imagine what it would feel like after a classical section. I recommend getting up and walking as soon as you can post op. When I finally started moving around 5 days later it got a little easier each time. I moved slowly for weeks but going back and forth to the NICU probably helped my recovery as it got me moving. 


After 25 days in the NICU we graduated and took baby home. She is now a delightful 5 month old and you would have no idea she's a preemie. She is starting to hit growth charts and milestones for her actual age. We have no reason to believe she will fall behind her peers. 

With her birth story in mind and me being high risk in the future, I would still consider a second. We may not, it's not a decision for us to make anytime soon. It is astonishing what we would do for our children. If you take nothing else from my birth story, realize how capable you are of overcoming childbirth and more for your baby. You've got this. 

It took me awhile to write this up but it's important for pregnant women to know to trust your body and call your doctor if something doesn't feel right. I'm lucky that my doctors knew something wasn't right and watched me extremely closely. I'm also lucky that I delivered at a hospital with nurses very familiar with HELLP. You are your own best advocate. If you do not think you are being taken seriously, you must switch providers or at least visit triage. Never once was I made to feel silly for going in. Right now the US has the highest maternal mortality rate of first world countries and that's unacceptable. HELLP syndrome takes lives each year. I don't mean to scare anyone, but high blood pressure readings and a preeclampsia diagnosis probably saved my life and my daughter's. As well as amazing medical professionals. 

I also want to share that the NICUParents subreddit was fantastic during my daughter's stay. I highly recommend checking it out if you unfortunately may be or are in the NICU with your baby. 

I think many of us have a vision in our head of how the birth will go and that almost never happens. Even if you did practically have a unicorn pregnancy and birth there's generally something that doesn't happen according to your plan. It's ok to mourn that process. My birth is probably more traumatic than most (I hope so, anyway) but that doesn't invalidate anyone's feelings. I was envious of all my friends with normal births but that doesn't mean they aren't struggling in other ways. 

It's important to look on the positive side. I didn't get to hold baby for 24 hours, but when I did, I held her at an earlier age than most moms get to hold their babies. I was lucky the hospital I delivered at had the NICU so I could just go up a few floors when I was healthy enough. Also, NICU nurses are phenomenal and really taught us how to care for Baby L. These people are literally angels. 

Since bringing Baby L home she has been a fantastic, relatively easy baby. We have been very lucky in that regard as well. Being her mom is the greatest hat I've ever worn and I'd do it 10 times over again. 

*Tips to pass on*
-Hospital bag. Stop overly obsessing about what to pack. It's going to vary based on the type of birth and your hospital has most of it. 
In my opinion the must haves would be: chapstick, nice robe (for pictures to throw on top of your hospital robe), dry shampoo (especially if you have a c/s because it will be tough to stand for showers), travel sized cosmetics for your everyday makeup. All the recovery stuff the hospital has. Even down to nursing pads. 

-If a c section happens, have your support person get you a small pillow. I had a boppy maternity wedge that was extremely useful. You'll need it for car rides, coughing and sneezing for a few weeks. 

-Also even if you think you don't want to pump, get your pump through insurance beforehand. I had 0 interest in pumping. A NICU baby changes that. I wish I'd already taken care of getting a pump beforehand. 

-Lastly, it doesn't hurt to discuss the what ifs with your support person. My husband knew to go with baby. He also knew to tell doctors we wanted to donate baby's cord blood. These are good things to discuss well ahead of time and hopefully you'll never have to face challenges. 

Good luck to all you pregnant Mamas out there and remember to always speak up for yourself.

It‚Äôs not a life changing amount of money but it was definitely needed. I am so upset at myself. I have been crying for the last hour to the point of almost throwing up.

I don‚Äôt think he means to but in his comfort is making comments that just make me feel worse. I am sure hormones aren‚Äôt helping but I feel like the worst partner and so irresponsible like how can I take care of our child when i can‚Äôt even keep track of a check and some cash? I am so angry with myself.  I can‚Äôt even be upset at him because of his comments because I am the one who lost his money and I feel like i deserve the guilt trip.

216,"I loved reading super detailed birth stories when pregnant, so I thought I would share mine :)

My pregnancy was normal and healthy. I did gain too much weight (50 lbs) but I started from a healthy weight, so my OB wasn‚Äôt concerned about it. Towards the end of my pregnancy, I started having consistent Braxton Hicks contractions, but other than this, I didn‚Äôt see any signs that my body was ready to have the baby - a frustrating feeling for me being a FTM. I wondered how/when my body would start to go into labor. Would it be weeks before or at the very last minute?

I started getting cervical checks at 36 weeks, but my cervix was still hard and closed. With each check, my cervix seemed harder for them to find, in fact. At 36 weeks, the check was just a few seconds, and at 38 weeks, the doctor was digging around in me for a grueling 60 seconds before she announced I was still closed. She also said my cervix was ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù whatever that means!

I had another check-up scheduled at 39+3, Friday (last week, actually!). My blood pressure was really high at this appointment (159/91). I never had a reading that high - usually if I‚Äôm anxious, my BP will be in the 140‚Äôs and then dip down to the 120‚Äôs after some deep breathing. The nurse and I both said, ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt good‚Äù when we saw the number. I felt anxious waiting for the doctor to come in and check me, as thoughts of preeclampsia and c-sections crossed my mind. I tried to tell myself, however baby wants to come out is fine, but in reality I was terrified of having a c-section due to high blood pressure. The exact same thing had happened to my mom with her first baby, so I was hyperaware of how the possibility.

As soon as my OB walked in the room, she said I looked puffy (thanks, bitch) and that they needed to retake my blood pressure. She checked my cervix, which took even longer than the last three times, and I was still closed. My blood pressure normalized to 129/71, but I wasn‚Äôt getting off the hook that easily. My doctor said to go to triage on Sunday in order to monitor it, and if it didn‚Äôt drop, they‚Äôd need to induce me. I felt scared about the possibility of an induction (and the string of interventions that could follow) but excited that I could be meeting my baby that weekend.

That night, my husband and I went to a D&amp;D night at our friends‚Äô house. I wasn't really feeling up to it, but I figured it might be our last night out for a while. I had a weird pain in my stomach and when we got home, I realized I was having mild contractions! They continued all night, about 10 minutes apart. I was disappointed when I woke up that morning and they were still sporadic and inconsistent, which continued until I went to triage Sunday morning.

My mom drove me to the hospital around 8am, and I brought my hospital bag but left the baby bag at home in case they didn‚Äôt keep me. I arrived, filled out some paperwork, put on my hospital gown, and got hooked up to a BP monitor that took my vitals every 15 minutes. The first BP reading was borderline high (in the low 140s) but every other reading was normal. Eventually, the nurse came in and told me she needed to put an IV to draw blood and as a precaution in case I needed to get fluids. 

I knew something was up. Why would they put an IV if they thought I might go home? I asked the nurse if I would be going home, and she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs looking like an induction.‚Äù Again, I had conflicted feelings. Was an induction really necessary if I didn‚Äôt have preeclampsia? Did a few high BP readings really justify this? On the other hand, I thought about the fact that my pregnancy would soon be over, and I did trust the doctors to make the right decision for my health. 

After this, things unfolded more quickly. I was told I‚Äôd be placed on Cervadil, which would soften my cervix, and then pitocin, which would help me dilate. The part that worried me most? This process could take 72 hours! Looking back, I‚Äôm not sure what I was feeling at the possibility of a long, hard induction. I felt like it was out of my control at this point and I had no option but to go along with it. What could I do, refuse medical services? What if I did and regretted it? 

I was moved to a labor and delivery room where I would stay until the birth of my baby. The nurse ordered me a lunch tray, which I could barely eat because I was so nervous. At 1pm, the Cervadil was placed against my cervix, and I started to countdown the hours until 1am when the dilation process could begin. I called my husband and told him to stay at home, clean up, and get the house ready for the baby. He said he‚Äôd come to the hospital around 9pm with the baby bag. Since my mom was with me, I still had company.

For the next few hours, my mom and I just hung out in the delivery room, watched TV, and chatted. I should mention that my mom is a nurse at the hospital where I chose to deliver, so we already had a few visitors, which really helped break up the time. It helped me distance myself from the situation, too. 

Around 4pm, I started to have some mild cramping, which the nurse said was a side effect of the Cervadil. This is where the timeline begins to get a little hazy because the mild cramping quickly turned into full-blown contractions. I could feel them and see them on the monitor, though the monitor didn‚Äôt show intensity. They started to become more powerful, and I asked the nurse if this was normal. She said it depends on your pain tolerance, since the Cervadil does cause cramps, and I told her that the pain was becoming unbearable. My mom suggested I get an epidural, but I was still thinking about the possibility of a 24-72 hour induction process. I said I wanted to wait until I was closer to delivering the baby so I wouldn‚Äôt be stuck in bed with a catheter for days on end. 

The pain got worse. Soon, I was moaning out loud in agony every minute and a half, and that‚Äôs when my mom demanded a doctor come in and check me. I was obviously in active labor - this wasn‚Äôt some minor cramping from Cervadil - but the nurses refused to see that, and I was too caught up in the pain to advocate for myself. A resident came in and removed the Cervadil, dug around in my vagina for a while, and announced that I might have been 4cm, but she was having trouble finding my cervix. I said something like, ‚ÄúI fucking know my body.‚Äù 

The lead doctor working that night came in and checked me. My mom called my husband and told him to rush to the hospital - we were having this baby sooner than expected. I screamed in pain as the doctor checked me, said I was 100% effaced, and she was going to bust my bag of water. This freaked me out, and I said, ‚ÄúCan I have a moment to process this?‚Äù I thought, did I want this to happen? Should I tell them to stop? What about all those podcasts where the women refused to have their water busted for some reason or other? But another contraction hit and I just moaned as she stuck a stick inside me and allowed a gush of water to pour out. This part didn‚Äôt hurt. Or maybe it did hurt but the pain of the contractions distracted me.

The doctor left after busting my bag, and my mom asked if I wanted an epidural. The problem was, I wasn‚Äôt sure how far along I was. They speculated 4cm, but that wasn‚Äôt a given, and I didn‚Äôt want the epidural to stop my progress. This had happened to my mom, and she ended up having a c-section. However, after a few more minutes of contraction after contraction every 1.5 minutes, I asked for the epidural.

They immediately started me on a new bag of fluids and said after I‚Äôd had the entire bag, the anesthesiologist could administer the pain meds. The contractions came in waves. I could feel them rise, peak, and fall; in between, I braced myself for the next wave by trying to relax and tell myself it would be over soon. The pain was absolutely incredible. Later, my husband told me I was screaming so loudly he could hear me from the birthing center entrance when he finally got to the hospital. 

At 7:30pm, the anesthesiologist finally arrived. My husband and mom were asked to leave the room for 45 minutes since this was a sterile procedure. The nurse had me hug a pillow and stay completely still as the needle was inserted. This, surprisingly, was the easy part. I hardly felt the needle, and the anesthesiologist immediately gave a tiny shot of medicine, which instantly relieved me. I was able to stop yelling and relax. The whole thing took about 10 minutes, and then I was able to lie down as the medicine took effect. 

My mom and husband were able to return, and the doctors were finally able to check me. I was 6cm! The Cervadil had apparently lit a fire under my uterus‚Äôs ass, and I was well on my way to having a baby. I was so happy my mom was there to advocate for me and get them to take it out, otherwise the nurses may have continued to write off my contractions as ‚Äúcramps.‚Äù

My mom went to her department to find a spare room and get some sleep, and my husband and I dozed off while Infinity Wars played on the TV. After a few hours, the epidural became lopsided, so I asked the nurses to prop up my right side. There was a small section on the right side of my belly where I could feel a mild version of the contractions, and I noticed how often they were coming - still every minute! I tried to sleep but this little bit of pain kept me up. Still, it was nothing compared to the full, unmedicated contractions. 

Around midnight, I asked the nurse if she could check me. They hadn't done a check since I was 6cm, and I began to feel a pressure that wasn't there before. As she dug around (thank god for epidurals) she said gently, ‚ÄúGuess what, Natalie? You're going to have a baby.‚Äù 

She woke up my husband and began to set up the room for delivery, which meant elevating the gurney, putting my legs in stirrups, and bringing bright lights from the ceiling down. Another nurse walked in and was introduced as the baby nurse who would look at my baby once he was born. 

The pushing stage was surreal. Because my epidural had one spot where it didn't work, I was able to anticipate contractions, which helped. I also only pushed for 5 second intervals (they wanted me to do 10) because anything longer may have triggered my asthma. I was in my own world and closed my eyes between pushes, visualizing my baby coming down and out. I thought of my sister, who delivered my nephew one year and five days earlier, and I thought of all the birth stories I'd read and listened to. I breathed, relaxed, opened up. The rest of the people in the room - the baby nurse, labor and delivery nurse, my husband, my mom - made small talk among themselves between contractions and left me to my own world.  

When my son was about ready to be born, the nurse called in the doctor, who guided me through my final pushes. She said my second push was my best, so I should try and hold that one for 10 seconds. After a few pushes, she said, ‚ÄúHis hair is blonde!‚Äù I couldn't believe it because my hair is dark, and I assumed my dark hair would beat my husband's blonde. This would be the first blonde in my family. 

It took about 10 more minutes before I felt a gush of fluids leave my body and my son was placed on my chest. My husband and I cried. He was squirming and oddly colored but so beautiful, and so much like his father! I didn't think it was possible for a newborn to so closely resemble another person. I thought it was silly whenever people would say a baby ‚Äúlooked like so-and-so‚Äù but now I understood because my son was the spitting image of daddy. 

Little Logan latched right away and nursed for a few minutes. I remember my husband and I were in awe of his chubby arms, sweet face, tiny toes, and him in general. He looked so finished! After the golden hour, he was weighed (8.8 lbs) and measured (19 inches). We were transported to the recovery room and passed out for a few hours. If I had known it would be the last time I'd sleep for the duration of my hospital stay, I would've tried to sleep a little longer!

I‚Äôm now five days postpartum, and the thing that has helped me the most has been family. As soon as I got home, my dad and step-mom came over, took the baby, and let me sleep for a few hours. This was indescribably helpful since he had been fussing since 2am the previous morning, and I felt so shaky. It's impossible to sleep in the hospital with people checking you every hour. My mom stood over the first three nights also to let me sleep for a few consecutive hours each night. And my husband has been cooking, cleaning, and fetching things for me so I can focus on breastfeeding and healing. After five days, I feel pretty good, and I am positive it‚Äôs because my village has allowed me to rest!

The biggest lifehack I picked up from the internet was the ‚Äúbreastfeeding box.‚Äù Basically, my husband bought a $5 canvas box from Target, and I filled it up with snacks, small drinks, lotion, BB cream, some mascara, Tylenol, a book (one for me, one for baby), and prenatal vitamins, and some other random things I use during breastfeeding. Seriously, putting some BB cream and mascara while he nurses has helped me feel like a normal person instead of a postpartum mess.

Overall, my delivery was a great experience :)  ","Birth Story: positive induction, vaginal delivery, FTM",1

LONG TEXT WALL AHEAD!!

DH and I have both wanted to be parents since we were kids ourselves. I think we started sharing our favorite baby names around our sixth date! I always dreamed of toothless baby smiles and first time ‚Äúmama‚Äùs. DH would constantly talk about things he couldn‚Äôt wait to do as parents, like being the obnoxiously loud, cheering parents at baseball games or eventually teaching our kids how to program (yes ladies‚Ä¶ I got me a computer geek!). We got married on October 6th of this year, which was (stereotypically) one of the happiest days of my life. Pretty much as soon as the rings were on, we immediately starting thinking to ourselves, ‚Äúokay, now we get to FINALLY have kids, right??‚Äù We did, however, decide to cool our jets a bit and not get ahead of ourselves. Everyone around us was saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have kids right away!‚Äù ‚ÄúEnjoy married life by yourselves first!‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce you have babies, you‚Äôll wish you had more time alone!‚Äù On some level, we knew they were right. We roughly decided we could hold of trying for about a year. Admittedly, we weren‚Äôt being very careful (c‚Äômon, we were newlyweds!). But in my mind, what were the chances of getting pregnant without trying?? People try for months, even years, to conceive; even when both parties are totally healthy! Besides, we had plenty to do before welcoming a baby! DH was toying with the idea of looking for a better job, I had just finished a degree and was planning on taking some certification tests and finding a job in my new field, (not to mention my new job would allow me to work from home which would be a HUGE plus with kids!) We were also still renting an apartment in the cities. How the heck would we be able to fit a baby into the mix?

Well, we were about to find out. For the last few weeks, I was feeling pretty bloated and crampy, along with slightly sore breasts. Nothing unusual before my period, so I thought nothing of it. But AF never followed. Last Sunday, a little more than six days ago, I remember waking up and saying out loud to DH in a lighthearted tone, ‚ÄúI think I was supposed to get my period by now?!‚Äù However, I‚Äôm a relatively irregular girl, so we made some jokes about it and went on with our day. On our usual Sunday grocery trip, I recalled that we were supposed to go get drinks with my brother that night. On a whim, I grabbed a pregnancy test and threw it in the cart. ‚ÄúJust to cure my paranoia!‚Äù I told DH assuredly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not pregnant,‚Äù I even told him, ‚Äújust want to be able to drink guilt free tonight!‚Äù When we got home, I went directly to the bathroom to ease my suspicions, still really not believing any extra lines would show up. However, as I squinted at the test, the faintest, almost opaque extra line showed up. I pretty much immediately stood up, cleaned myself up, and raced back out the door, telling DH ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust this one, I need to be sure!‚Äù as I laced up my boots. I returned with three more pregnancy tests, all different kinds. Lo and behold, the second test I took was impossible to ignore; the second pink line almost glowing it was so bright. I was in such shock as I looked at my DH not even able to say the words. Thankfully, he was more than happy to, as he grabbed my hands and said ‚ÄúYou. Are. Pregnant!!!!!‚Äù

The next few days were so full of joy, a type of happy like I had never experienced before. On Monday morning, I took yet another pregnancy test, a digital one, and the giant ‚ÄúYES+‚Äù solidified my excitement once again. I left the test on the sink while my DH slept as I slipped off to work; thinking, while driving, about how ecstatic he would be once again when he saw the test as soon as he woke up. I downloaded not one, not two, but three different pregnancy tracking apps since I could not get enough of reading facts about our growing baby; things like how baby looked like a little tadpole, or how baby was only the size of a little teeny appleseed. Our little baby appleseed. My husband, slightly frantic but coming from a place of bliss, kept texting me suggestions all day. Things like, ‚ÄúYou should start taking prenatal vitamins now!‚Äù ‚ÄúShould I get a physical? Does that even matter?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you know car seats have an expiration date??‚Äù We spent every night that week curled up on the couch that week, basking in our little warm glow of what was to come. Suddenly, our little apartment didn‚Äôt seem so little anymore, as we started mentally rearranging our space to welcome our new little bundle of joy. I started to feel tired, a tired I have never known before. After 13 hours of straight sleep I was STILL exhausted! I also started crying at the drop of a hat. I once even started welling up because I thought my husband didn‚Äôt want to watch a movie with me! But through the tears I smiled because I knew that these were signs that my body was just busy working on our baby. 

While we knew it was probably still too early to do so, we did decided together to tell a few select people close to us, people that we would turn to for support during any other tragedy. We wrapped up little baby socks and gave them to my parents (who we are VERY close with) disguised as an early Christmas present. As this was their very first grandbaby, they were THRILLED! My mom screamed and cried; my dad, a 6‚Äô3‚Äù burly man with a hard outer shell to match, let a few single tears well up in his eyes and talked about how amazing it would be to be called ‚Äúgrandpa.‚Äù Of course, we warned them nonstop about how it was still so early, a lot can happen in these first few weeks, and they should be prepared for anything as we weren‚Äôt in the clear yet. But at the time, they felt like empty warnings because I felt so confident that this was meant to be and everything would go perfectly. I mean, I‚Äôm the mother, right? If something was wrong, I would feel it, sense it, right?? We bought matching ‚Äú#1 Aunt‚Äù and ‚Äú#1 Uncle‚Äù coffee mugs to wrap and give to my sister and brother for Christmas. We started daydreaming fun ways to surprise DH‚Äôs family on Christmas, as they have been making jokes about us being pregnant for years. We did remain cautious, and constantly told ourselves it was still SO early, but I don‚Äôt think either of us truly believed anything would go wrong. I remember at one point just turning to DH one night, looking at him and just saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so‚Ä¶ happy right now. This is just‚Ä¶ such a happy time. I love this.‚Äù

On Friday morning, exactly six days after our lives changed, it changed yet again. I was at work using the bathroom, and when I wiped I saw what every pregnant woman fears the most. There were a few faint streaks of blood on the paper. I felt my heart sink all the way to the floor, but tried to stay calm. It was just a little bit, and blood doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the worst, right? The well-meaning nurse I called next reassured me that a little bit of blood isn‚Äôt always a sign of concern, and to call back if it started to get worse or if I started to experience cramps. I think the next few hours were the slowest hours I‚Äôve experienced in a long, long time. I would run to check myself in the bathroom about every half hour. I actually started to calm down as there wasn‚Äôt really any new blood, until about 3 hours later, when I wiped again and again saw streaks of red, this time brighter and much more prominent. ‚ÄúOkay, screw the nurse‚Äôs line,‚Äù I thought to myself. I conjured up a feeble excuse to give to my boss and hurried to the nearest Urgent Care. I think as soon as I saw that second streak of blood I knew what had happened, but I had to be sure. My DH arrived at the Urgent Care about ten minutes after I was whisked back, quite literally as the doctor was pulling the speculum out of my body. He threw the speculum in the trash, and I could see it covered with red liquid and small clots. One blood draw and ultrasound later, we were back in the UC exam room anxiously awaiting our doctor to return with the verdict. I think my DH was much more hopeful than I was, or maybe he was forcing himself to be. He kept saying to me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay. I really, really think everything will be okay.‚Äù Or maybe he was telling it more to himself than to me. I, on the other hand, somehow knew deep down how this would turn out. Finally, the doctor returned, his head buried in some paperwork. As he shut the door behind him, he asked us matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúSo, they told you there‚Äôs nothing in there, right?‚Äù For the second time that day, I felt my heart sink down, deep deep down, into my feet. I heard my DH gasp. I think the doctor knew by the looks on our faces that no one, in fact, had told us that. ‚ÄúAhh, well‚Ä¶‚Äù he tried to recover, ‚Äú there‚Äôs nothing on the Ultrasound. They couldn‚Äôt find anything.‚Äù After a long moment of stale silence, my DH asked faintly, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we were never pregnant?‚Äù *Well, that just can‚Äôt be it.* I thought to myself frankly. *I felt the side effects! I could feel my baby inside of me! No way that was all in my head‚Ä¶ or was it?* ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the doctor answered, ‚Äúyou were pregnant. For a little bit. It just‚Ä¶ never took. The blood you‚Äôre seeing is actually your period.‚Äù My‚Ä¶ period? ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I asked, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a miscarriage I‚Äôm having?‚Äù I could see the doctor get more and more physically uncomfortable and could tell he just wanted to bolt. ‚ÄúWell, technically no, it is your period. Conception happened and the embryo started to develop, but sometimes, they just don‚Äôt stick. I‚Äôm really sorry. I think an OB-GYN will be able to help you a lot with this.‚Äù He stood up and started shuffling his papers around, muttering something about sending a nurse in to help schedule the appointment with an actual OB and left the room in a hurry. I looked at my now openly crying DH, still pretty shell shocked myself. He just wrapped his arms around my shoulders and let the tears run down his face, something I had rarely seen up until this point. I felt empty, like a hollow shell, unable to feel anything even if I tried. I knew this was happening since this morning, deep down I truly knew it, so why was it such a shock to hear it spoken out loud? 

Next, a nurse came into the room, a small, strong looking woman with kind eyes. She rubbed my knee and looked me in the eyes, telling me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you. It‚Äôs happened to me, my daughter, my daughter in law‚Ä¶ I know what you‚Äôre going through and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone.‚Äù (seriously... thank God for nurses. They are the absolute best!) After the new appointment was scheduled, still stone faced, I started to ask her ‚Äúoh, so in January I have‚Ä¶‚Äù and then this is where I started to lose it. And by lose it, I mean openly weeping with no regards as to who was around. I managed to indicate through blurry vision and gasps in my voice that I had my first pre-natal appointment scheduled, and that would probably need to be cancelled. I‚Äôm not sure why I felt that was so important to be dealt with right at that moment, but the nurse nodded and rubbed my arm and assured me she would take care of it all. 

And that was it. We walked out of the exam room and through the lobby out to our cars, not caring who saw us cry. I think what was so shocking to us was that at the time, we still barely had a clue what was happening. It was explained so poorly to us. We got home late in the afternoon and we immediately went to bed, curled up in the blankets, and just held each other while we cried. How did this happen? Why did it happen to us? What did we do wrong? Everything we envisioned for our new future just‚Ä¶ collapsed, basically. Just was taken away in a single instant. In my mind, it was almost like the whole time we were playing a sick game. It was as if we were just playing mom and dad, like we were just pretending the whole time, but now the game was over and it was time to go back to reality. It was only six days, but those six days were a whirlwind of novelty, excitement, joy, and love. 

When we finally out of tears and energy, I scoured Google for any further explanations to tide us over until our OB-GYN appointment two whole days from now. I‚Äôm almost positive it was a Chemical Pregnancy. I had heard the term thrown around before, but never really knew what it was. Now, I wish I did know more beforehand so I could be ready. I feel almost na√Øve as I read hundreds of different websites detailing what chemical pregnancies are. How did I not know about this? 

That was yesterday afternoon. Today, the wounds are still fresh but the shock is gone. I sometimes find myself hoping that I‚Äôll get a call from the doctor‚Äôs office, saying that they were looking at the wrong Ultrasound results! They made a mistake and everything was fine! But I know that‚Äôs not going to happen. It‚Äôs even more real now that AF has come into full swing. I hate it so much. Every time I go to the bathroom it‚Äôs just a visual reminder of what‚Äôs not there anymore. 

My mom called me before I could call her, asking how us three were doing. But I know after my empty ‚Äúumm‚Ä¶‚Äù and silence, she knew what had happened, with a soft ‚Äúoh no..‚Äù She has been amazing, though. She has been grieving with us and comforting us, but also not needing us to comfort her back in this time. She assured us that yes, we did make a new life. We are still parents. I am a mom now, just like I always wanted to be. We made a brand new life, and now that life is up in heaven watching us. My dad says when he dies he‚Äôll finally be able to meet his first grandchild and he‚Äôs so excited, and I still can‚Äôt think of that phrase without crying. They‚Äôre arguably much more religious than I am, but those thoughts are still so comforting in this hard time.

I almost feel guilty, although I know I shouldn‚Äôt, that I at least got to experience some sort of bonding with the baby that DH never did. At least, just for a tiny, fleeting moment, I got to have baby inside of me. We were together at least for a brief time. I also catch myself feeling almost silly for mourning a baby that we only knew for six days, but when I start to feel that way I immediately shut those thoughts down. A loss is a loss, no matter what. Our feelings are valid and I truly believe anyone else who has suffered a loss this early feels the exact same way.

We decided to name him Johnny, since we were calling him our ‚ÄúLittle Appleseed‚Äù during the last week (and yes, we also decided he‚Äôs a boy!) We thank Johnny often for giving us a little taste, a trial run, of what‚Äôs to come. He gave us confidence that yes, we are ready to be parents, and when finally are again it will be truly amazing and we will be too. 

We are doing okay. Actually, we‚Äôre doing better than I anticipated. We are taking this weekend for just ourselves, to allow ourselves to grieve and be sad and really feel these feelings as they come and go. In the meantime, our apartment has never been cleaner! It was actually very refreshing and therapeutic this morning to deep clean and scour almost every inch of our living space as ‚Äútherapy.‚Äù We also decided to pull the trigger on a purchase my wonderful penny-pinching DH has been planning to make for a long, long time. He‚Äôs now deep in the middle of building his brand new computer from scratch and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder. We are sad and shaken by this experience, but we are also strong. We are so strong and so resilient and so in love and we will come out of this better, hand in hand, ready to take on anything. Hopefully, that next thing to take on will be our second, full term child! However, if that doesn‚Äôt come next, I am confident that whatever does, we will be able to face it head on. 

But for now, on the day one after those six days, being just ‚Äúokay‚Äù is plenty.",Six Days: My Chemical Pregnancy Experience,1

Thanks ladies!",37 weeks and feeling.... great?,1
220,"I've been meaning to write this up for a while to keep the details straight. It was a perfect experience, and it was the birth I had been aiming for with my son. Which isn't to say his wasn't a positive experience but merely that it was different. Hoping to be able to provide some contrast between an uncomplicated vaginal with epidural and an uncomplicated unmedicated delivery for anyone weighing those plans.¬†I didn't go in with any particular plan this time because my epidural before had been technically perfect for pain relief but had some inconvenient side effects (more detail later). 


I had a membrane sweep at 37+4, and I scheduled an induction for 39 weeks at that appointment. I was very concerned that this baby wasn't going to come on time, and our childcare plans and help from relatives depended on arrival before our due date. I had no BH at all during pregnancy, and after the membrane sweep I had a few intermittently but no apparent progression toward labor in spite of spending the next two days obsessively walking around. I was beyond frustrated, even though logically I had over a week until my induction.¬†


I know a lot of patients who seemed very happy with their inductions, but it wasn't the labor experience I wanted for myself if I could avoid it. I liked being able to labor in the privacy of my own home for a while and having a shorter stay on L&amp;D. I also didn't have a great Bishop score, so my doctors and I were concerned about the time required/success of that process.


At 38+1 I woke up early to what felt like baby stretching out very uncomfortably. I've been in labor before, and this didn't feel quite as intense. However, I felt my belly the next time it happened, and it was definitely a contraction. I timed a few of them out, and they were coming every 6 minutes and lasting 30-45 seconds. I got up, took a shower, and woke up my husband. He got our toddler ready and called our sitters while I folded some laundry and generally straightened up a little.¬†


This is where it gets a little funny (to me). About 2 hours into this my contractions were 3-4 minutes apart but still less than a minute and not very intense. I called my doctors' office just to let them know if they needed to rearrange their schedules or get themselves some snacks for L&amp;D, because at this point *last time* they had me wait at home longer, and I labored for another 17 hours. Apparently the medical assistant I spoke to wasn't sure what the protocol was, so she offered to let me come in for a cervical check in the office. Cool, I figured, can avoid going into L&amp;D too early and see if I'm making any progress.¬†


Apparently I was forgetting that I was a second timer now. So when my doctor saw me on her schedule she about panicked and called me 4 times to try and send me to L&amp;D triage instead, but of course I missed all of those phone calls on the drive over. She did check me when I arrived, and somehow I was already 6 cm!¬†


At this point I still wasn't concerned because I could still walk and talk through my contractions. We felt fine driving the 10 minutes to the hospital ourselves, and my doctor called over to direct admit me and bypass triage. She would follow us over once she cleared her schedule and finished up a few office tasks. My husband dropped me off outside, and I walked myself in while he went to drop our toddler off with the sitters.¬†


I was very excited to get immediately offered a room with a jacuzzi tub to labor in because those were all taken last time --our practice has a reputation for attracting a lot of crunchy patients, so they were also preemptive about picking a nurse who enjoyed working with that. Having a nurse who supports what style you want is crucial! At my hospital after initial fetal monitoring you can opt for intermittent if you don't have an epidural, and some of the nurses really resent having to come in to do the intermittent monitor and having to do more support during labor while others really enjoy it.¬†


My husband got back about an hour later, and my water broke within a few minutes of that. Last time this was when it got really intense, so I readied a barf bag and bounced on a yoga ball while we filled the tub. At this point, contractions were more intense but manageable. I moaned a little through contractions and just tried to focus on a distant point and separate myself from the experience.¬†


The tub felt glorious! Unfortunately I didn't get to enjoy it for long. About 3 contractions in my doctor came in to check how I was feeling, and I felt like I needed to have a bowel movement. I was certain I couldn't be complete, because it just didn't feel as powerful as I expected, but I agreed to let her check me before using the toilet. She was right after all--complete!


Out of the water contractions while laying on my back felt awful, but they were doable on all fours. My doctor grabbed my nurse and told me that if I felt the urge to push I could trust my body at this point. Things were starting to feel really urgent, I was shaking, and I was really questioning this decision not to get an epidural but telling myself I could get myself the rest of the way. My hospital will absolutely do them at 10 cm, but I felt like it was a waste of the side effects and recovery time if I could just get through this last bit without it.¬†


I've heard people say that pushing is actually a relief at that point. I completely believe them, because the first push felt great. Baby descended super quickly, though! Right after that first push she was crowning, and the ring of fire was definitely NOT a relief. I was just screaming semi-incoherently for them to get it out at that point. It's hard to know how many pushes it was totally because you're just pushing with everything you've got whenever you have the energy then, but our baby girl was out less than 5 minutes from that first push. It was truly incredible how immediate the relief was. I was sore, but it was like the pain of birth immediately left my head. We had our golden hour, placenta delivered fine, a borderline second degree tear along the scar from my previous delivery that required just a couple stitches, and I was up walking around the room and taking myself to the bathroom immediately after that. A total of 6 hours from first contraction to delivery.


On comparing epidural vs not: The timing was really key. I don't regret my previous epidural because I was so totally exhausted and dispirited from so many hours of labor. I did not appreciate a lot of the side effects, though: blood pressure drop requiring multiple doses of medication, continuous monitoring made me anxious, fetal heart rate decels after I couldn't move around as much anymore, being rolled around like a whale in bed to correct said decels, back pain the next several days at the insertion site, and some issues emptying my bladder. In the context of a quick labor the short term intense pain was absolutely worth the trade off for the immediate recovery I experienced. If I had been progressing slowly again I would have gotten the epidural again.

221,"So, let me preface this by we are going to try to do everything we can so he can be there, but there is still a very real possibility that he could miss labor and delivery.  

My husband has interviews for the next step in his career training and they are March/April.  I am due March 26th, and am a FTM.  We have set a plan where places that he is most interested in for training he will try to choose dates for that are either as early in march as possible or as late in April as possible.  That being said, some places only have one or two interview dates, so he may not get much say in when he interviews.    


I also have plans in place, where during those two months any time my husband is traveling my mom will be coming up to stay with me (so I do not have to be alone when I go into labor or potentially for delivery).  And we plan to have her stay after the birth for a bit since my husband does not get paternity leave, and frequently has to work 24 hour shifts.  

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I am concerned that even with the best planning we can muster he will miss the birth.  Since some of his interviews are far away and he will need to fly.  so in some cases, even if he can get a flight immediately, it could still be 6-7 hours before he could get to the hospital.  Obviously I plan to call him the second labor starts to maximize chances he can be back in time.

223,"Sorry for the formatting (I'm on mobile). Anyway first time posting with ya'll. Thought I'd ask if anyone has had any trouble with pregnancy insomnia. 

I'm 14 weeks currently but this started at about 10 weeks when I got prescribed my nausea medication (ironically the doctor said it might make me sleepy because it's also used to help with insomnia). So I've had sporadic sleep schedules, sleeping 1.5 hours on some days and sleeping for 10 hrs (ended up going back to sleep for another 10 hrs after only being awake for 3 hrs) on others. 

The worst was when I couldn't sleep for about 44 hrs. 24 hours in I needed to go to the store for food (I had only been eating canned food for a few days), thought I would finally force myself to cook since I hadn't had the energy to recently. I have this pasta recipe that's pretty easy to make and one of my favorites. I actually got excited to have a cooked meal. I get to the store, it's busy and I'm starting to have a panic attack from being in the way. I struggled with the self checkout, fairly certain I looked insane because I'm exhausted and frantic. I finally get out, and I'm almost home when I realize I forgot to get the penne (meaning I cant have the meal I was so excited about). I'm too tired to go back and I just started sobbing in my car. I know it's dumb to cry over but I was so exhausted. 

My husband was gone for work, and my family and friends are all in another state, so dealing with this stuff and being awake mostly during the night made me go a little crazy. I hadn't talked to anyone in weeks other than the occasional phone call to my parents. 

So does anyone have similar stories or experiences? And if so what helped you regulate your sleep schedule? Also let me know if you want that recipe. ",Pregnancy insomnia from hell,1

232,"32 weeks pregnant and having a rough time. 

Other underlying health concerns and my mental health is suffering. I‚Äôm feeling very anxious about leaving my job as an educator and have questioned every moment in this pregnancy. I have my own life, routine, and house that I own but so does my partner. We live apart because I‚Äôm allergic to his dog and his (cough) bachelor cleaning habits (lol). 

Well...tonight he said ‚Äúmove in with me. We can carry 2 mortgages for a while and then see if we can live together before we decide on either selling both our houses and buying one together...etc.‚Äù

Being 7 frigging months pregnant, I am NOT moving. I am in no financial position to move, nor pay for storage for any of my possessions. I will never rent my house out for any reason. I was taken advantage of by my ex husband and he has left me in financial and emotional ruin, which I am still legally dealing with. 

And HELLO, if I‚Äôm going to be going through the trauma of actually having a baby, don‚Äôt I deserve to be comfortable when I am recovering? I‚Äôm not comfortable at his tiny little house and my emotional state has been fragile to say the least. My overall health has been on the decline as well from chronic medical issues which can‚Äôt be good for the baby (I‚Äôve had to go for 3 fetal assessments already and am measuring 3-4 weeks behind at every appointment).

They say the most stressful things to have happen to you while you‚Äôre pregnant are the loss of a loved one, divorce/marriage, and moving. But he thinks this is best.

I don't know if it's because I work in retail and since my ankle is injured I use a stool and the bending over a lot is just effecting me or if it has something to do with my pregnancy or both! I dont particularly care what the cause is, it just sucks! the only reason I think it may have something to do with the pregnancy is because it doesn't go away whenever I am off for a couple of days. it's not excruciating or anything but it is uncomfortable enough to make it hard to sleep well (as if I needed more trouble sleeping in between all of the pee breaks and random bouts of nausea lol)  does anyone have any advice for lower back pain relief? especially at night?? its definitely it's the tailbone-ish area. ",lower back pain in early pregnancy?,1
234,"I am 25 + 4 and had a routine MW appointment yesterday.  Baby and I both have had a noticeable growth spurt in the last couple of weeks, but the scale still shocked me.  I put on around 15lbs in 5-ish weeks.  I have been on track up to this point and entered this pregnancy at a healthy BMI.

The first thing she says when she comes into the appointment is ""we need to talk about your weight gain. What has changed? Where are the extra calories coming from?  Are you stress eating?"" Etc.   I understand she is looking out for the baby and myself, but ouch.  

Sure I have been eating more, but I only drink water, eat a salad for lunch, skip breakfast (always have), and generally snack on dried fruits/nuts. I also quit smoking and drinking when I found out.  This was super difficult.  I definitely used that as an appetite suppressant. 

I have a history of an eating disorder (EDNOS).  I struggle greatly with needing to control my body.  It has been very hard to sort ""let go,"" in a sense, with pregnancy.  I have been actively avoiding all reflective surfaces for the last few weeks.  

I am still running a couple times a week as well as using my home exercise equipment (free weights, incline bench, bodyweight exercises) a few days a week as well.  It's only been in the last couple of weeks that I've even started showing and I can definitely tell that the weight is in my thighs/hips.  

What made this hurt the worst was that I had a positive body image moment in front of my bedroom's full length mirror earlier this week (a huge deal for me, pregnant or not) and now I am just crushed.  

It doesn't help that my husband won't touch me anymore but that a whole different can of worms.

235,"This is long I'm sorry please bare with me. 

So I recently found out I was pregnant (about 4 weeks ago) and my LMP put me around 5 weeks at the time. My aunt told me to make a doctor's appointment around 8 weeks so that was my plan. 

I talked to my manager at work and she gave me Wednesday off last week to go see my doctor. I called to make an appointment and the receptionist told me he no longer works Wednesdays. So I let my manager know I'd need a different day off the next week. She gave me Tuesday off so I called again to book my appointment. The next day they called me and told me my appointment was canceled because the doctor wouldn't be in on Tuesday this week and they wanted me to reschedule which I couldn't because I didn't have my new work schedule yet so I told them I'd call them back. I managed to convince a friend to change shifts with me and scheduled my appointment for Friday at 12:30. They told me to arrive 5 minutes early. I don't drive so I bussed there and arrived at 12. 

They had me pee in a cup immediately and then sit and wait. 12:30 passed. 1:00 passed. At 1:15 I went back up to the desk and politely asked the lady if she knew how long it would be as I'd been waiting since 12:30. Before she said anything another receptionist beside her said ""oh they're busy I've just been avoiding making eye contact with you guys"" Thanks lady. I have no problem waiting but a heads up that they were behind would have been nice. 

At 1:30 the receptionist said ""so Janayabug has gone in yes?"" And I was like no? And she just stared at me and asked if that was me. I told her it was. So she took me into a room and then told me she couldn't find me on the computer. Then she asked me who my doctor was and I told her. We were in the wrong doctor's office. She moved me to the correct room and left me there to wait for my doctor. 

At 1:45 my doctor finally came in. He asked me why I was there and pronounced my name wrong. (I've corrected him every time I visit, I've given up at this point). I told him I was pregnant and he asked if it was planned. I told him it wasn't, but that were happy anyways. Then he asked me if I'd peed in a cup. 

Why did I even bother peeing in a cup of the doctor doesn't even know about it?? He doesn't know why I'm here he doesn't know who I am and he doesn't know what he's doing. 

Then he asked me if I had any questions. I didn't. I didn't come here for a Q and A. I came for a referral for an ultrasound. A form for blood work. And a pap test and whatever else they felt was necessary to do.  He acted like I was stupid for not having questions and he told me most people have questions. I still didn't. He then explained to me that this is my first pregnancy and that I've given birth 0 times. (Woah I had no idea) he gave me the referral form for an ultrasound and what I thought was a form for blood work. And he told me I needed to call the local maternity clinic and do everything else through them and that I already should have seen them, and if they couldn't get me an  appointment within the month  to come back and see him.He also gave me a prescription for an anti nausea as my morning sickness is horrendous. 

I left and went to the pharmacy to get the prescription filled and they didn't have it so I went to the grocery store nearby. They told me to come back tomorrow. I said I couldn't cuz I didn't live in the area and wasn't coming back just for this. So the guy told me to come back in half an hour (big fucking difference there) I figured while I waited I'd go get my blood test done as the lab was a 5 minute walk away. I realized at that point they put the wrong address on my form but I wasn't bothered enough to go all the way back and wait even longer. 

At the lab I let the lady know the address was incorrect and she said it was fine. Then she said ""so Dr. *wrong name* is your doctor?"" 

Nope. That doctor doesn't even work at the clinic anymore. 

""Well his name is on this sheet""

My doctor is using the previous doctor's forms. He's signed his name on another doctor's paperwork. Fuck my life. She had to call someone else to get it sorted out. She fixed all the info herself so I didn't have to go back. She then informed me that the test would take an hour. I was like excuse me? An hour for blood work? And she said no it's for the 28 weeks gestational diabetes test. 

I'm not 28 weeks. I'm 9 weeks. 

The blood work form wasn't even for blood work. It was to test for gestational diabetes. I'm nowhere near needing that yet. It wasn't even mentioned at my appointment. I wanted to cry. I told her I'd come back later. 

I left and called the maternity clinic. They didn't understand why my doctor hadn't given me a referral form for them. Apparently no one just calls to book appointments. I told them I didn't have an answer for them and they booked me an appointment anyways. So my first appointment won't be until January 22nd. I'll be almost 15 weeks by that point but I don't even care. I'm never going back to my doctor again.

237,"Hey all.  After a bout of sneezing earlier in the week, I suppressed a sneeze and felt a ‚Äúpopping‚Äù sensation in my left side rib cage.

I had been dealing with pain in the same location for the previous four weeks which my GP and Midwife both indicated was from my uterus stretching my ribs out of alignment.  The pain was awful at times, but was slowly getting better with panadol, baths and heat packs.  The pain is a dull ache but when I sneeze or cough or laugh it‚Äôs like being stabbed with a hot knife in my ribs.  

Well after the ‚Äúpop‚Äù yesterday I was in so much pain I thought I was going to pass out.  It ended up subsiding after a few hours and went back to being just painful.  Last night however I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable in any position in bed and I felt a stabbing pain with every breath or movement.  I ended up going to the ER at 2:30am after I woke up and the pain was even worse.

Again, the diagnosis was strained ribs or muscles.  They won‚Äôt do an X-ray for the obvious reasons, but prescribed me some strong pain killers with codine to use sparingly.  I went home and finally got some rest but on waking the pain is not much better.

I honestly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to cope for the next few weeks waiting for the baby to arrive.  If I take the codine tablets I can‚Äôt drive but that‚Äôs the only thing so far that has dulled the excruciating pain in my side.

I wonder if it would be any idea to go to chiropractor or a physiotherapist.  I‚Äôve never been to either and I‚Äôm so far into the pregnancy I feel like it‚Äôs not worth really risking it.  My midwife did say I could try chiro at my 34 week appointment, but the pain is substantially worse now and touching the ribs is agony.

238,"It was absolutely one of the worst experiences of my life. 

I'm almost 10 weeks along, and in between insurance providers. I applied before I discovered I was pregnant, it just hasn't kicked in yet. 

Knowing I needed to verify my pregnancy, get an ultrasound and talk to a Doc, I decided to go to Planned Parenthood! I donate to them frequently and love them a lot. 

Well. 

My DH was suppose to come with me, but had an important last minute work meeting he had to attend to. No biggie, I'm a big girl, I can do this. 

So I thought. 

When it came time to pee, I froze. I have a tiny bladder. This is never a problem. Drank lots of water, nada. 

I broke down crying in the bathroom. 

Nerves and being a little upset that this wasn't my cutesy little pregnancy fantasy probably got the best of me. 

Plus the fact that I'm very, very tired and this morning sickness hasn't let up for the past 4 weeks.  

It's been fun.

Anyways, I sheepishly went back up to the desk and through sniffles and red face asked if I could reschedule. 

The lady at the desk was so kind and got me out of there so fast. 

The second I stepped foot into the elevator I just broke down. 

I was upset at being alone. I was stressed at myself for not being able to pee. I was upset that this wasn't what I had planned. 

We've been over the moon since we found out, it was just... a moment of weakness. 

As I'm walking back to my car, I'm met with loud voices. 

""Shame on you!"" 

Wtf? Are they talking to me?  I look around.

Ah, I spot the signs first. 

One jingles something in their hand at me and says something I couldn't focus on. 

Mind you I was already sobbing at this point.

I probably looked like a deer caught in the headlights. 

Religious protesters. 

Of course.

I want to summon my strength and explain I'm here to keep my baby and they're all dumb idiots and I'll see them in hell, but I couldn't. 

I was just so damn tired. 

So I cried even harder and scurried off to my car.

I hear what sounds like triumph behind me.

I drive off and just keep driving, blubbering to DH over the phone about how bad this sucks and how I can't believe what just happened. I don't know why it bothers me so much. I just can't believe people are so cruel and okay with making ANYBODY feel like shit. 

He apologized profusely for not being there and he's coming to my next appointment. 

He says he's going to make up for it. 

He says next time we can bring eggs. 

I came into work after debating if I should even bother, and now I'm at my desk crying again. 

I could really use a friend.

(Oh, and the second I got home I immediately peed. Yayyyyyyyy.)

239,"So I'm using a throw away since the SO knows my actual Reddit name..

Anyway, I'm expecting my first child and my SO has a preschooler whom I love soooooo very much. He wants a baby shower since his family couldn't attend the shower for his first. Completely understand but Everytime I get emotional I just don't want the shower because:

1. I don't want to be the center of attention.
2. He has already gone through this and I feel weird about it...

He tries his hardest lately, more kissing of the belly and tells me he loves me but I constantly think on bad days he is comparing to his first. Me and his BM get along great and can easily communicate when there is issues with their daughter. His daughter absolutely loves me which hurts more because I want her to have everything she wants but I also want this baby.. to which my focus will be on this baby almost entirely cause first time mom tiredness and trying to breastfeed. We are trying to prepare his daughter but I'm afraid she will have issues because:

- she has abandonment issues it seems.
- hates when I do not give her every second of my attention.
- when dad is around she rather have my attention and has told him so.
- she hates, HATES, when I'm doing anything other than giving her attention.
- sometimes tablet or TV will give me time alone but it's not every time.

So with the baby shower dislike and my worry about SD attention needs has sent me into a panic and I've been feeling drained. We have her until a month or two after her baby sister will be born. Yeah having another girl at first made me feel awful cause I couldn't give my SO his first son nor the first grandson his parents wanted but I've always wanted a girl. 

He has encouraged me this is all new and he was never this attentive to his BM when she was pregnant... Although I've seen the baby shower photos and they are hugging, kissing and showing so much love to each other. They broke up not long after SD was born and was together a short time. SD was not a mistake and knew their actions would result In BM getting pregnant while my pregnancy was a mistake. Two years earlier than planned as I wanted us to be married before the pregnancy for atleast a year... But the world has other plans as all the birth control failed us.

For my first, we were living in very rural Wyoming and I delivered in the closest big town.  That town happens to be extremely wealthy with stunning, brand new hospital facilities.  I had a private labor suite for the entire time and the last family was discharged just as I was induced so I had the entire L&amp;D ward to myself all weekend long as I labored, delivered, and recovered.  All the nurses were available for me, we could walk the halls in total solitude.  We've since moved and its suddenly occurred to me that this is highly abnormal and I should mentally prep myself for a standard delivery in a semi-large city.

Can you share your experiences?

\- Induction - did they start the night before or early morning? Were you ever rescheduled because they were too busy?

\- Labor - were you immediately admitted? Were you sent home or told rooms were full? Did you have to labor in a waiting room?

\- Did you have a private room? Were you moved from labor to recovery room? Were they standard room or suites (with birthing tub, for example)?

\- Was it busy with lots of other families around?

246,"I don‚Äôt see a lot of posts on here about how birth experiences can be affected by mental health and previous unrelated trauma, so I thought I would share mine in case it helps you plan and prepare (as much as you can). 

I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I did struggle with anxiety and depression throughout pregnancy but was medicated and sought therapy. 
Despite this, I had little to no ptsd triggers while getting prenatal care, not even during internal exams. 

After a few high blood pressure readings and baby movement concerns, we decided to induce at 40 weeks. So we were admitted and began Cervadil. I sent my partner home to sleep overnight. Sometime early in the morning a nurse came in a woke me. Without much warning and while I was still half asleep, she stuck her hand inside me to check my cervix. Looking back, this was the initial trigger. Over the next few hours I began to increasingly panic when doctors and/or nurses would enter the room. Cervical checks became so painful that I was bawling and writhing on the bed during them. They were so much worse than the contractions that had started. Throughout, the nurses would do a cervical check, and sometimes not 15 minutes later the doctor would come in and do it again. 

My partner had returned and had called our doula to join us. Our doula helped me to ask the doctor about whether cervical checks were necessary. She agreed that nurses didn‚Äôt need to do them, but that she would still need to do them. She said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre probably going to be doing this for the next 18 hours, you aren‚Äôt dilated at all yet.‚Äù 

And THAT sent me over the edge. The thought of enduring these checks for that long or longer, all while my anxiety increased and THEN to get to the actual birth which was was going to be so much more invasive than a cervical check. My PTSD ramped into overdrive and my pain tolerance tanked. 

Meanwhile, there was a nurse who kept referring to me as ‚Äúgirl‚Äù as a term of endearment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, girl, you can do this‚Äù, ‚Äúhow ya doing, girl?‚Äù - I don‚Äôt like diminutive nicknames in normal circumstances, maybe it was the stress, but I wanted to slap her. 
After 6 more hours, I could not take another cervical check. I called my therapist In the hopes she could help me with coping techniques. But I was dealing with the trauma I‚Äôve spent nearly 10 years in therapy for, there was no coping mechanism I could learn in an hour or two that would get me through the birth without serious mental health repercussions and a permanently negative association for the birth of my only child.

I basically opted for an ‚Äúelective‚Äù csection. I felt horrible. Like I was letting my baby down, myself down, my husband. I was a complete failure that I couldn‚Äôt just suck it up. 

And this is why I‚Äôm writing my birth story. Nothing could be farther for the truth. My little boy was born via no emergent csection. With a little extra medicine to control my anxiety, his birth is something I remember with such love and fondness. I do not permanently associate the birth of my child with my abuse beyond those first few hours of agonizing over the decision. I have some hilarious memories of the anesthesiologists and my husbands banter. My baby came into this world safely. 

I wanted to share this so you know it‚Äôs okay to opt for a csection for mental health reasons AS MUCH AS  medical reasons. My baby is 8 months old, i no longer feel bad about my decision. I absolutely did what was best for me and my baby.

So here's the deal: I am overweight and to be honest I have always struggled with my weight.

The lady who was performing the scan was all the time commenting: ""it's too much fat"", ""I cannot see anything properly, oh you see for yourself how hard it is to do the examination with such a thick layer of fat"", ""why didn't you monitor your weight before you became pregnant?"", ""I won't be able to tell you the sex of the baby cause as you know I cannot see things properly"" and so on and so on...

One I can't find much information on is called welchol. I use it because I have no gallbladder and get retched bile acid diarrhea otherwise. The drug itself doesn't seem to have an effect on a baby as it's not absorbed into the bloodstream. But it can affect the absorption of vitamins. 

Has anyone been on this or similar? My doctor didn't have much input on it.

My sister said he was ill on Monday and Tuesday, one of those days he had a fever. But he refused all food and fluid from monday-wednesday. He was lethargic, non communicative, and sleepong 98% of the time. She brought him to the emergency room Wednesday, and they drew his blood but didn't send it out and it clotted and they told my sister and mother that it was too expensive to rerun the bloodwork and probably just had a virus and discharged her. Despite him still being asleep and unable to stay awake for any period of time.


She tells me all this around midnight Wednesday and I begged her to take him to a different better hospital near us (there are 4 in the region and 1 is the best in the tristate area for kids) and she said she was going to wait until the next day. Idfk why.

She took him to the hospital yesterday, his electrolytes were severely unbalanced, and his sugar was on the low end of normal. He has since become unresponsive. Not responding to stimuli, or his parents. He'll open his eyes but won't focus on anything. And he started having seizures.


My sister lives with our drug addicted biological father and the only thing I can thing of since his bloodwork shows he's not sick, is that he ingested drugs. But my sister won't tell the Drs that. Our mother may. But I don't know.

263,"Really looking for advice from anyone who has been through this. This is my second pregnancy, first was complication free. 
Yesterday we did an ultrasound, and the tech found a thickened nuchal fold, which of course is a sign of possible Down syndrome. We have another ultrasound scheduled for Tuesday so they can try to get a better picture and measurement of it, depending on the results of the ultrasound we will do blood work that day. If the blood work comes back positive I‚Äôll go ahead and do an amino to be 100% sure. 
Right now nothing is definite, but I just have this gut feeling that I already know what the answer will be. 

I know this will sound extreme to some people, but I am devastated. I have watched both sets of grandparents spend their life raising a child with disabilities. My uncle has an extremely severe form of muscular dystrophy; he can‚Äôt even move his wheelchair himself. My aunt of the other side of my family had the cord wrapped around her neck when born and she was actually dead for a few minutes, before they resuscitated her. The lack of oxygen to her brain caused her to be mentally challenged. 
I‚Äôve watched both sets of grandparents spend their lives caring for their children. With my uncle it has severely limited my grandmother, she isn‚Äôt even able to leave the house for long periods of time, without a sitter. 
In addition, once my grandfather gets to old, or passes it will become my aunts responsibly to care for her sister. I know she loves her, like we all do. But her children are grown, she‚Äôs just about to retire, she is living it up doing everything she‚Äôs wanted to do. That will end when my aunt becomes her responsibility. 

Am I a horrible, selfish person for not wanting that life for myself or eventually my son? 
I‚Äôm trying to not stress out until Tuesday, but‚Äôs it so hard to not run through the what if‚Äôs. I‚Äôve cried so much since my midwife told me. 
My husband would prefer to terminate the pregnancy if the results are positive, and if I‚Äôm honest with myself that is what I would think is best as well. But the thought of killing my baby is destroying me. It‚Äôs not the babies fault. It‚Äôs just sitting in there, expecting nothing but to be safe. I support a woman‚Äôs right to choose, but I just don‚Äôt know if I can emotionally handle one, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong enough. 
I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have the right to mourn my baby, that I wouldn‚Äôt get to be sad. Because I‚Äôm the one who choose to end it.

268,"This story is a long time coming as my child was born over 2 years ago now. Tl;dr at the bottom. Part of the reason I want to share is to help me continue to process what happened with my birth. So here it goes.

I had my 40 week appointment at 40+1 and everything was looking great. My blood pressure was 105/50s and baby was happy as a clam. My OB did a sweep to try and jump start labor. I did have about 10 hours of braxton hicks contractions the next day that were 5-7 minutes apart. But these fizzled out by the evening.

Two days later my husband and I were eating dinner when I started to feel a trickle between my legs. I hadn't peed my pants at all my whole pregnancy so I thought this might have been my water breaking. We waited for about 30 minutes and I kept feeling it so I called the hospital and spoke with my OB who happened to be on call that night. He said to make our way to the hospital and they would check to see if it was amniotic fluids. We called our doula at this point too and let him know that we were heading to the hospital to get checked and that my water might have broken.

The car ride to the hospital was much calmer than either of us initially imagined. My hope had been to labor at home for as long as possible, but I had a strong feeling that I should go get checked. And I'm so glad that I listened to my intuition.

Once we got to the hospital and checked in to L&amp;D the nurse did a fluid check that showed no traces of amniotic fluid. Turns out I just peed myself or was having lots of other vaginal secretions.  Whoops. 

It was good that I was already at the hospital though. When they checked my blood pressure it had shot up to 150/90. There was no traces of protein in my urine yet, but they were concerned I might be developing preeclampsia.  OB said that they were going to start an induction and that I wasn't leaving without a baby! I got a small dose of a cervical ripener (can't recall the name anymore) around 9 PM with a plan to start pitocin in the morning if things weren't progressing.

By this time our doula had gotten to the hospital as well and we all tried to get some rest. 

The cervical ripener did the trick for me though, about 2 hours later I was having regular contractions that were impossible to sleep through. So we all got up and found a groove of pain management through the contractions. Things kept progressing overnight and I got in the shower for additional pain relief at about 8am. This helped tremendously and is also when my waters really broke. It really did feel like a Pop! and then tons of fluid started gushing out. I totally didnt expect it to continue to come out, but there was loads with each contraction that I had after that. 

Except for while I was in the shower they were constantly measuring my blood pressure every 15 minutes. It stayed high but wasn't going up so they just continued to monitor .

After getting out of the shower I decided that it was the time to get into the tub. They had to do a cervical check at this point and I was at 7 cm so we got the green light to go in the water. Things got really intense at this point and time is pretty blurry as I was in transition. I remember shaking really hard toward the end of my time in the pool which our doula assured us was normal and indicated that I was getting close to the end. I started having an urge to push at this point so the nurse came and helped me out of the tub and back to my room so they could check on my progress (no water deliveries at this hospital).

I was almost at 10 cm, but had a lip of cervix left so they had me pant through contractions for a really long time trying to get this last bit to budge. It was so so difficult to not push during my contractions at this time and I spent a bunch of energy just trying to not push. They had me do this from 11:30 am until 1 PM. It is important to my longer story that they never resumed checking my blood pressure after I got out of the tub at 11:30.

Finally at 1pm the OB checked my progress again and said that she could stretch the lip out of the way enough that I could start pushing. I was so relieved to be able to actually be doing something!

We did a few practice pushes in bed and then I got up and used a labor stool for about 2 hours. I definitely pooped several times during this, but thought it was good because it reflected I was using the right muscles to push. Pushing was satisfying but made everything more intense. The feeling of the baby descending through my pelvis was very uncomfortable.

After 2 hours of pushing baby's heart rate started to decelerate so they had me get in bed on my left side. This brought it back up so they let me keep pushing. I pushed for about 40 more minutes going from my side to my back and then to kneeling on the bed. By this point I was utterly exhausted.  I hadn't slept in almost 36 hours. And I had been pushing for almost 3 hours. My vision was started to get pretty distorted at this point and I remember asking my husband and doula if I had burst any blood vessels in my eyes, but they said no. In retrospect, I realized that this was when my blood pressure must have been really really high. 

The nurse suggested trying a vacuum extraction since I was totally wiped out and I agreed. I just couldn't keep pushing on my own.

Things moved quickly at this point. The OB came in with the set up and talked about how if this didnt work then we were heading to a c section. They had me lay on my back again and turned on this super bright light aimed right at my vagina. They also started pitocin to help my contractions be stronger.

They had me do a few pushes before attaching the vacuum. Getting the vacuum on hurt a lot because they basically had to stretch things out of the way to get a good grip. The OB also did an episiotomy at this point. Three pushes later bubs was here. It was such a feeling of relief.

I hadn't realized that the room filled up with other doctors since there was meconium in my waters later on while pushing. Since baby came out crying we got to do skin to skin right away before they took him to evaluate. During that time the doctor started to stitch me up, I had a severe third degree (almost 4th degree) tear.

The room started clearing out again and not too long later they started checking my blood pressure again, which was now 160/100. They ran some labs and did the urine test again which showed protein in my urine and developing liver damage. Sometime that night they started me on a magnesium drip which I was on for 24 hours. They also had me on a fluid restriction to help get the right level of magnesium to prevent a seizure. I was allowed like 8 ice chips every 4 hours, I felt like I was dying of thirst, it was almost all I could think about. I had to stay in the hospital for 3 full days after my child was born as they had to keep increasing my blood pressure medicine as my BP kept going up. I was super happy to be able to go home with a plan to follow up with my regular OB the next day.

All of this made my milk really delayed in coming in. This resulted in baby losing too much weight and developing newborn jaundice requiring bililights. They were thankfully able to sort this out with home care so baby didnt have to go back to the hospital. I cant say the same thing for myself...

At my OB follow up my blood pressure was even higher than when I left the hospital. I increased my BP med again and was told to stop taking ibuprofen as it might be making things worse. I had to follow up again the next day and when my blood pressure was even worse then they decided that I needed to be readmitted to the hospital for another round of the IV magnesium. I was back in the hospital for 3 more days until they found the right med combo. I was in so much pain from my severe tear during this time too. I had to be on meds (including strong opiods) around the clock and was still hurting. It was really challenging. And I physically felt so debilitated, which I know was partially due to the magnesium drip. 

Once I got out of the hospital the second time baby was also off of the bililights and gaining weight with supplementation of donated breastmilk. I ended up having to stay on BP meds for 2 months postpartum and was officially diagnosed with severe post partum preeclampsia. This was so unexpected for me as I had a pretty easy pregnancy, was at a healthy weight before getting pregnant and didnt gain too much while being pregnant, I also stayed really active even until the day I went to the hospital. 

Tl;dr Totally healthy pregnancy with complicated and long delivery with vacuum resulting in severe tear. Developed post partum preeclampsia and was in the hospital for a week and bp meds for 2 months after giving birth.","Birth story, unmedicated, complicated and slightly traumatic (preeclampsia and severe tear, baby in 2016)",1

[My daughter's birth story was a lot different from my son.  To recap, his was a scheduled induction due to being too big, got an epidural and then vaginal birth. You can read it in my post history :\)](https://i.redd.it/kv8p77yzja421.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

39 weeks today and waiting to pop again, will post that story as soon as she comes. So here's my daughter's birth. Sorry it's long, When I wrote it I didn't want to forget anything. I tried to narrow it down a bit but it is still long! 

Background: My son, husband and I traveled to Guatemala in August 2013 to visit family and handle some business. At first, I was having a blast, enjoying my in laws and finally meeting my husband's side of the family. I was playing with the kids of the family every day. I still remember them begging me to play Justin Bieber videos for them on my laptop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, one day, I stopped having an appetite. Didn't want to eat anything. Everything smelled weird to me, including the paint on the walls. I started telling the kids I wanted to be alone and locking the door to our guest room. I felt terrible because they would come and knock and beg to hang out with me. Still feel bad about it to this day!

&amp;#x200B;

I felt awful, and I told my husband I thought I had food poisoning. It actually happens a lot to Americans who travel abroad. I pretty much stopped eating and was afraid to touch anything, even water. I remember we got home one day and I got out of the car. My mother in law (abuela) smiled at me and took my arm. She told me in spanish ""I will help you up the hill since you are expecting another baby""

&amp;#x200B;

I laughed and thought she was joking but she was absolutely serious. I told her I wasn't pregnant, that there was no way and brushed it off....but she knew before me haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after she said that, I started to think about it. I realized I hadn't gotten my period yet. I wasn't quite late yet but I didn't have any symptoms of it coming. So we went to the Guatemalan Walmart (a really different experience btw) and bought a pregnancy test. I thought my period would come that day just to make me look like an idiot but it didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we all know what happened. Took the test and saw the positive!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't scream in the bathroom this time like my first. I silently went to the kitchen where abuela and my husband were waiting. Abuela had a knowing smile on her face and hubby looked at me curiously. I burst into tears and handed him the test. I couldn't say anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after that I think I lasted 2 more weeks over there and decided to come back to the US. I had a weird blood pressure issue (always do when pregnant where it is super low and causes me to faint). I was sitting on the couch eating a sandwich and got spots in my eyes and almost fainted....yea...I wasn't even standing lol. Well, we went to the doctor over there and the doctor just confirmed my pregnancy and said ""don't know why that's happening. Here's a tylenol?? ""

and sent me home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I didn't feel comfortable anymore and booked a flight home on 9/10...without my husband because he had to finish business. We had been planning to stay quite long and he couldn't leave in the middle of everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember the drive to the airport. I was so nauseas I threw up out the window and it went down the side of my brother in laws car (his baby)   ew....I was so embarrassed! 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we got there too late and I missed my flight. I was secretly happy because leaving my husband behind hurt...a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

So our flight was rescheduled to the next day...9/11. Did NOT want to fly on that date but that's what ended up happening!

&amp;#x200B;

My 1 year old son and I got on the plane alone. It was horrible. He was crying constantly missing daddy and I was sick and pregnant. I cried on the plane and a sweet 80 year old Guatemalan man comforted me...he didn't know english but he could feel my pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, sorry for all that background but I feel like it related to this pregnancy. The pregnancy went smoothly except for that fainting thing. It happened at the dollar store and a nice lady gave me cold water and I got better...ugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to March, 8 months pregnant and Husband finally came home. It was the best day ever! He didn't work at the time so we spent every day together until the baby's due date. It was the best 1-2 months of my life!! 

&amp;#x200B;

However, toward the end I started to get very impatient and sick of being pregnant. Constant heartburn every day, pain in the hips and back, etc. I started to wonder if she would ever come! I kept swimming right up until the end and took walks as well. I only gained about 30 lbs compared to 70+ with my son...yikes! 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I started to get super impatient and asked hubby to buy castor oil at the store for me. He flat out refused. We were really set on going natural this time. Our first birth wasn't traumatic but we wanted to do everything differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, instead of buying the oil, we went to the park. The parking lot was super full due to an event so we had to walk the long way over a bunch of hills. I think this is what finally set labor off for some reason. Not sure why though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Got home still in desperation. I walked into the bathroom and PSSHHHH!!!! My water broke right then. It was 5pm. I looked at my husband and said "".....this is it......"" His face turned white. Contractions actually started right away and just felt like Braxton hicks for awhile. Maybe a slight difference I guess. I would gush more water with each contractions so I ended up getting one of my toddlers' diapers and putting it under a pad in my underwear (lol). 

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds so weird I know but it worked so well. I'm planning on getting actual adult female diapers this time just because I've read so many posts on here that recommend them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I ended up posting on facebook that my water broke (big mistake) and soon everyone knew I was in labor and kept asking ""how are you? baby here yet?"" Drove me crazy and I won't be doing that again. My parents got dinner delivered for us and we all had an amazing meal at home watching funny tv shows while I labored. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started timing them while eating and they were speeding up fairly quickly. They jumped from every 10 minutes to every 5 or 4. I was writing them down and remember thinking ""hmmm, I think it's getting close"" but I still wasn't in much pain. Just felt like period cramps with pressure and for some crazy reason part of me thought this might not be the real deal. I read a lot about prodromal labor and was convinced this wasn't it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember going in the kitchen to clean up after eating and suddenly having to stop during a contraction and focus on getting through it. My mom noticed and said it might be hospital time. Stubborn me said no and that I just wasn't sure yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

That paper I was writing times on? They eventually went to every 2-3 minutes and I left the paper downstairs. My mom found it later and totally freaked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went upstairs to my room and put my labor music on. I put all of my favorite songs on my mp3 player with headphones. This didn't work quite like I thought it would. They were my favorite songs that gave me energy for workouts and things like that but during labor you really need peaceful, relaxing calming music to keep you from freaking out. One of Adele's songs came on. I think it was 'rumor has it' and the contractions stepped up. I couldn't focus on the music anymore. It just sounded like loud static noise in my years and I ripped the headphones off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it was instinct, I'm not sure, but I ended up in the bathroom after this. I sat on the toilet thinking maybe I needed to go or something and ended up somewhat comfortable there. The contractions got even worse and were almost nonstop. No breaks! 

&amp;#x200B;

I started yelling at this point, I couldn't control it. My husband showed up pale faced (no idea where he was all this time). He saw me on the toilet and apparently remembered this was something women do when they're close. He grabbed me and said I had to MOVE. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refused at first. I just wanted to stay there and yell. But he forced me up. I grabbed the sink as another huge contraction hit and yelled some more. 

Note: Even though I read a lot of birth stories for this labor, I didn't prepare for my fear or anxiety at all. No yoga, no calming nothing so I kind of lost control at this point with my fear. I screamed a lot because I wasn't sure what was happening and was afraid which made the pain 10 times worse.

&amp;#x200B;

In between contractions, my husband managed to get me back in our room and I grabbed the dresser as another one hit. I remember my mom showing up and she got in a huge fight with my husband......great......just the best time for an argument right? 

&amp;#x200B;

She was on the phone with a 911 EMT and they were telling her I should stay home and let the baby come and they would be there soon to deliver. My husband fought with her saying we needed to be in the hospital ASAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally I started screaming that I was going and just wanted relief. Between contractions I managed to get down the stairs...and another one hit. Then I got to the car somehow and after that it felt like there were literally NO breaks between contractions. 

&amp;#x200B;

The entire car ride is just a blur of pain because of the bumps and my husband's crazy fast driving. We finally got to the hospital and my husband ran in and got a wheelchair. I don't remember it but I think they tried to make me register but I was screaming so loud they didn't push too hard and just waved me through. 

&amp;#x200B;

The poor security guard. He had this awkward look on his face and pushed my wheelchair. I guess for liability reasons because I would have preferred my husband to push me. I literally screamed the entire way to labor and delivery upstairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once in my delivery room, there were 4-5 nurses there just waiting for me. They somehow got me on the bed and I was screaming for an epidural. Well, they checked me and I was a 10 and almost crowning so...no...lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

My anxiety really took over and I screamed even louder. The nurses told me to quiet down and try breathing as though I was blowing out birthday candles to try and stop the baby from crowning. I didn't listen much because at this point the urge to push took over. My whole body was in control and pushing actively. I tried to do the breathing but it felt like a lost cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor showed up and she took one look between my legs and freaked out. She actually pushed my legs together and told me to stop pushing because she wasn't ready. Ok, when she pushed my legs together it was the most painful thing ever. I immediately kicked her in the chest, it was like a reflex or something...or maybe she pissed me off a bit but wow. She was a bit mad after that but hurried up. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was finally ready and told me to try and slow down so I wouldn't tear. I did my best but like I said, my body was in control.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember finally calming down at this point. I was still scared and pushing was painful but I felt like the end was coming and there was nothing else I could do. I remember thinking how weird it was that I was actually doing this...me...no medicine no help. Just me. I think it both terrified me and empowered me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The head hurt to push out and I felt the ring of fire but I let out a battle cry and pushed her out when the doctor said. The relief was amazing! The shoulders were still hard but compared to the head were pretty easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter was born at 12:25pm after midnight on April 14th.  I was really happy because I didn't want her to come on April 13th (superstituous)

&amp;#x200B;

After she was out, I felt this amazinging feeling wash over me. A mixture of relief and some kind of endorphin high. I felt so strong, it was crazy! I didn't tear at all, just a small scrape and I owe that to the doctor. Even though she made me so angry she did a great job at coaching me and preventing me from going to fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

She pissed me off again though because she wouldn't let my husband cut the cord. She wanted to do it herself because that was ""her way of doing things to prevent problems"" whatever. They cleaned her up a bit and brought her to me to breastfeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I passed the placenta at this point, it was super easy and breastfed. I remember how weird it was to hold a newborn again but also marveling at how beautiful she was and feeling love for her. This was shortlived though because I suddenly started shivering like crazy. They say it's from an adrenaline dump after birth and all that fear processing. I felt so cold and just shivered away. The doctor assured me it was normal so I just let it happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point a nurse asked me to try to use the bathroom to make sure I could go. I brushed it off and said I didn't have any urge to go. The nurse then said I needed to empty my bladder, it was important so I went in. Well, after 5 minutes trying I came out and said ""no go"".

She then threatened to put a catheter in if I was unable to do it on my own. I told her I'd try again!! After my experience in my first labor, I was DETERMINED to avoid the catheter! 

&amp;#x200B;

I went in the bathroom, turned the sink on and flushed the toilet to hear running water. I put my hand in the sink water and imagined the water coming out. Luckily it worked and I went. I felt so much better! 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the stay was uneventful. Just getting to know my newborn and recovering. Recovery was MUCH easier this time. I felt almost normal by the 2nd day. Just a little weak like I overexercised or something. No tear, no painful sitting etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I will say this, I really didn't prepare well for this labor. I was conflicted and torn between getting the epidural or trying natural so I didn't read up on it very much because I just wasn't sure. The amazing recovery made it worth doing it that way but for this 3rd time around I've really tried to prepare myself more. I've read several books on calm birthing, getting through transition (the time that hurt the most) and reducing anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

The birth started at 5 pm after water breaking and lasted a little over 7 hours...so yea, definitely went quick. I attribute the quickness due to my ability to relax so much at home and laugh with my family. Everyone says to rush to the hospital right away but I've read countless stories of labor stalling, stopping or becoming long and painful because of that. I plan on leaving a bit earlier this time around but want to stay home a bit too. I'll definitely not wait for 2-3 minutes like last time! This could easily have been a car birth if I lived a bit farther away......doh!

I'm hoping to go natural again but will keep my mind open in case of emergencies etc. I've done hypnobirthing and practice exercises every night  and as much as I can on weekends. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my birth stories. I posted my first one already and after this third one comes will post that one as well. It's nice to have it all written out for me to read again and again when I feel the want to.

Born At 8:11 am 12/14/18 8lb 0oz at 38 weeks

Not going to post my entire labor story right now but the gist of it:

Got a membrane sweep t 4:30 in the afternoon on the 13th, started getting contractions pretty quickly after, even though they were painful I could walk and talk through them and they weren‚Äôt super consistent.

Fell asleep at 9pm with my daughter, woke up at 1am and they were coming 3 min apart and hurt like hell.

Booked it to the hospital and got there and checked in by 2. Was 4cm got checked and hour  later was 5cm and got admitted.

Got to our room at 6 and got the epidural and then I was in heaven.

At 7 the dr broke my water and told me I was 9 cm

At 8:00 we started pushing. At 8:11 we had our beautiful baby boy after just 3 contractions

284,"My husband and I are eagerly awaiting our first baby, any day now. I was prepared for all of the opinionated and unsolicited advice from our family and friends, but man oh man, it just never ends. Sorry, this will be a long rant. 

Our top priorities:
1. Gender neutral clothing, toys, etc. We want to give our child the freedom to choose the colors and toys that interest them, and not be bound only to what is marketed to their sex. 
2. Fewer toys, more experiences (getting outside, games and sports, learning skills like cooking, fishing, camping, building, going to the zoo/ parks/ things like that)
3. Limit exposure to technology (especially at a super young age; essentially, tablets and what not are not babysitters or teachers - we want to engage our child and have others engage with our child). Obviously, ""no tech"" isn't all that realistic, but we will do our best. 

My husband and I elected not to find out the sex of our baby. We feel very strongly about not forcing our child into super specific gender roles - we want to avoid ""prettiest girl"" and ""smartest boy"" branded and labeled clothing/toys. We really stressed handmedown items for guests to help reduce waste and cost - but we've been getting a lot of flack for these decicions. 

For example, most of the handmedown clothes we have received are blue/ greens/ grey/ other neutral colors. People are already telling us that 1- it isn't fair that our baby isn't getting brand new items ü§Øüò± 2- ""what if you have a girl!? She can't wear those boy colors"". 3- people aren't going listen to you. they will just buy your kid toys and technology and then be resentful when you try to parent your children/stress what we want. 

It is getting really frustrating to be told ""You have no idea. You're going to cave soo quick. You're going to get it one day"". All of these know-it-all attitudes are really unhelpful. Isn't family supposed to be supportive? Ugh. 

Anyways, I just needed to vent. I'm overdue and cranky and just generally unimpressed with the lack of support we have gotten from close family.

290,"Long, on mobile, TL;DR at bottom.

I am in tears right now. It is not a health issue (thank goodness) but a financial one. I‚Äôm not sure how I can be helped, I just need a place to vent.

A little back story, to my detriment I didn‚Äôt pay attention to my work-provided health insurance.  I never had health problems, and the monthly payments were covered 100% by my employer (small company, less than 10 ppl). I am 31 weeks along now and about to be 30 years old. I thought by this time I would be financially ready to have a child, and I thought I was.

Well, I find out that I have a $6,500 deductible. That by itself wouldn‚Äôt ruin me, but then there is the fact that it would view my pregnancy as one medical event and the birth as another, for which I would potentially pay 2 deductibles for (the pregnancy being in one calendar year and the birth in another). That I cannot afford. 

Well, I started stressing out about finding other options. Me already being pregnant was already going to hurt my chances of finding a lower cost option. Just talked to an insurance agent. Apparently no one will cover me because I am pregnant, my only option is Medicaid. I‚Äôm worried that my current doctor will not take it and I‚Äôll have to switch doctors this far along (and after I‚Äôve already made all my payments for the doctor).

But at our company update meeting, we were told that our insurance plan was changing to a $3000 deductible still covered 100% by employer. I was so relieved. 

After that, I ignored all the emails saying when the ACA open enrollment deadline was because I know longer had to worry about it.

Well, this morning, I received an email from my employer that apparently the broker received the wrong information from the insurance company and that the new plan would actually be a $7500 deductible. This being dropped on me the day before ACA open enrollment ends. I have done no research and feel so unprepared to make this decision on such short notice.

As I‚Äôm looking at other health insurance options, they are about the same amount of money whether it is a lower deductible with higher monthly payments.

I just hate that my whole pregnancy is plagued by the thought that I‚Äôve made a financially irresponsible decision to have a baby ever. Because with all the life problems that seem to pop up that need to be paid for, I just don‚Äôt see when I would ever be able to afford giving birth, let alone have money afterwards to actually raise my child. 



TL;DR My work health insurance was going to have a lower deductible ($3000 from $6500) but I was just notified that it was wrong and would actually be $7500. This will ruin me financially.",I think I‚Äôve made a terrible financial mistake of ever thinking I‚Äôd be able to afford having a baby.,1

294,"TL;DR Terrible itching! Need advice before I scratch my skin off!

Long time lurker, but first time poster. I am 28 weeks currently, and this is our first baby. I was diagnosed with preeclampsia about two weeks ago. It is very mild - I initially went in for a checkup one day and my BP was 160/106, but they were able to get me down to about 140, and my doctors are fairly sure it is stress induced. I only had protein in my urine once. I get scans once a week, and labs done once a week, and see my doctor once a week (for a grand total of 3 appointments). They are watching me very closely, and I am very happy with their precautions. So, I am a mild preeclampsia case, and I am on BP meds twice a day, a baby asprin, and an iron supplement. These pills are in addition to my prenatal vitamin. Additionally, I am on modified bed rest until delivery. I try to keep myself occupied at home, but you know how that is. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so that is all background information. My real problem here is this itching I suddenly have. Haven't had any issues at all with my pregnancy prior to the preeclampsia diagnosis, but in the last week I have developed the worst itching I have ever had in my life. It isn't on my palms or soles of my feet. My doctor told me it is most likely a PUPPP rash, which won't go away until delivery either (woohoo). However, it started just on my stretchmarks on my belly and has spread to all over my thighs, inside of my arms, love-handles, even my elbows. I use zyrtec once a day, benadryl cream, and hydrocortisone cream (all per my doctor), but the itching doesn't seem to get better. I also take oatmeal baths.

I just really need some advice on what else I can do to alleviate all this horrid itching. I think it is the only thing that brings me even an iota of stress right now, and it seems to be especially bad at night. I will wake up itching, or having scratched my tummy or thighs to bits.

295,"Just gave birth this morning, 38+3.

The night before last, I started having some really mild contractions around 6 pm. I timed them and they weren‚Äôt getting any closer together (random times between contractions of 6-20 minutes) so I figured it wasn‚Äôt the real deal. I went to bed after bouncing on my ball for a few hours at about 3 am. They were gone when I woke up at 7 am.

When I woke up, I thought I lost my mucus plug, except it wasn‚Äôt bloody. My underwear was also much wetter than usual, but not as much as I would have expected my water breaking to be. I decided to keep an eye on it (I‚Äôm GBS+) and mention it to my doctor at my 38 week appointment that afternoon. At around 1 pm, my underwear was wet again, through my pants and onto the couch. Again thought I was leaking fluid.

Went to my doctor‚Äôs appointment at 4 pm, and he said it probably wasn‚Äôt my water breaking and the contractions could mean labor would start soon, or it could be days or weeks. He decided to do an US to check my fluid level. US showed plenty of fluid, so he said not to worry. While I was getting my US, I felt really hot and nauseous, and I got this terrible cramp in my left side. Like a charley horse or a runner‚Äôs cramp, and it didn‚Äôt let up. My doctor decided to send me to L&amp;D to get checked out and make sure everything was ok.

After checking in, they hook me up to the monitors. I‚Äôd say the cramp was a 6/10 in terms of pain. The nurse did a swab to test for amniotic fluid and it was negative. The cramp eventually let up and I felt totally fine again, and it didn‚Äôt come back. The nurse said sometimes the baby can kick something or get stuck under the ribs and it hurts until he gets unstuck. 

The contraction monitor was picking up some really small contractions about 6 minutes apart, but I wasn‚Äôt feeling them. She said that if I didn‚Äôt feel them, that they would get stronger and that‚Äôs when I would know I was in labor and to come to the hospital. Again she said it could be a few hours or a few days. They sent me home after about an hour.

My husband and I picked up some food and went to bed around 9 pm. I slept fine until he left for work at 4:30 am. His truck left the driveway, and I immediately felt and heard the POP of my water breaking. I waddled to the bathroom with my legs closed and sat on the toilet, and tons of amniotic fluid came out. I wiped as best I could so I wouldn‚Äôt drip, and got my phone from the nightstand and called my husband to turn around. Then I got in the shower to rinse off. I stayed in there while he packed the last couple things in our go bag and fed the dog. I felt a small contraction about 10 minutes after my water broke, and a couple in the car.

We left for the hospital at 5 am and got to the ER around 5:15 to check in. We were wheeled up to L&amp;D at 5:30 or so. I was having some contractions but not really painful or anything. The nurse checked me and I was 8 cm. I asked for an epidural because I was worried about the pushing hurting, and they said they might not have time but they would try. 

They also said I didn‚Äôt have time for an IV, but I asked them to try because I was GBS+ and wanted the antibiotic. They overrode the computer system (because they‚Äôre supposed to have my blood labs back before giving me meds) and gave me one dose of penicillin.

I‚Äôd say around 6:15ish (?) they said I was 10 cm and it was time to start pushing. I pushed for a while, and the pushing hurt, but the back pain in between pushes was worse. I had to hum and roll my hips/legs in between contractions. I pushed for about an hour and a half with the nurse, and then they called my doctor. He said he was 15 minutes away. They had me keep pushing, but told me to only push for a count of 5 and to hold off if I could. I said no thanks and kept pushing anyway. They had the on call OB suit up, and she delivered the head. My OB showed up right then, suited up in a flash, and he delivered the body and the placenta. Baby was born at 7:53 am.

Baby and I did skin to skin as my OB gave me lidocaine and sewed up my undercarriage. Some second degree tears, and one that was almost a third degree. It hurts when I have to get out of bed to pee, but it‚Äôs fine besides that. But it‚Äôs only the first 12 hours, we‚Äôll see how my first number two goes.

Baby boy Calvin is good and healthy. A giant 9 lbs 4 oz (no idea why, neither my husband and I were large babies, nor am I overweight, nor did I have GD), 21 in long. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt make it to 40 weeks or he would have been huge... He has a big bruise on his head, so they‚Äôre watching him for jaundice. We also get the fun blood sugar checks every few hours because of his size. 

I‚Äôd say labor was a 7/10 pain wise. Not fun, but not quite as bad as I expected. I didn‚Äôt feel the ring of fire or anything like that. We spent a lot of time in Lamaze class and didn‚Äôt use any of the techniques we learned though. Either way I‚Äôm really happy with how my labor turned out. Not quite what I expected, but it turned out great.

D(ear)H is right there and notices my face go from normal to red to white and grabs me to get me to lay down on the couch. Long story short? I think I may have felt some Braxton Hicks. After 20 minutes and a hot shower the pains went away. HELLO THERE LITTLE ONE!! üòÇüòÇ,Well THAT‚ÄôS a new feeling...,1
300,"Here is my situation:

I'm due April 1st, however I will most likely be having a scheduled C-section which puts me about a week earlier. Both my mom and MIL are traveling for the winter and will be out of town until about the first week of March. This means that the soonest I could have my shower would be probably the second weekend in March. That leaves me with about two weeks before baby will be here. 

* This is my second child, but my first is 9 years old and I literally have *nothing* for this baby
* He is the first grandchild on my husbands side, and only the second for mine (only child) so even my family is excited. Both moms *must* be there.
* We live in a relatively isolated area, have essentially *no* maternity/baby stores within \~365 miles so anything we don't get from the baby shower would (most likely) have to be ordered online and shipped. Shipping can sometimes take weeks.
* I have *no* idea how many people will participate/show up to the shower. Family members have been bugging me about it already and voiced their wishes to go and that I ""better invite them"" - but I'm still skeptical that people will show. I didn't even really want to have one until my friend told me she was doing it regardless, and then numerous family members brought it up.

What should I do? 

I'm afraid that if I wait to see what guests gift us, it will be too late to order and have the rest of the items arrive before baby is here. But I've also been warned not to buy anything before the shower because for one, money is tight right now, and for two I don't need duplicates that I can't just easily return.

We are also going to be moving into a new house after Christmas-ish. Anything I buy now I will have to move from place to place (a long with an entire house and 7 years worth of stuff). 

Also, I have this fear that no one will even show up to the shower and I'll just end up purchasing it all anyways. Part of me wants to have my bases covered and not put myself in a bind. Part of me wants to stop worrying so much and just go with it.

Should I buy the essentials? Maybe some newborn stuff off of Marketplace just in case? Leave the extras up to the guests if they want? I feel like this is the realistic thing to do, but I've been warned not to by a few people. I don't want to rely on the generosity of others to supply the essentials for my baby. Its nerve wracking! But if I do this, there will be almost nothing left that baby needs, except for high priced items that I feel guilty for even having on the registry (stroller and crib) and I just don't want a bunch of random things that baby wont even use.

I don't know why I'm stressing so much about this :(

301,"I had DS in March of this year so he's 9 months old now, and I'm 10 weeks pregnant with baby #2. My son was really big for me. I was 110lbs when I got pregnant and at the end I was up to 162, and he was almost 10lbs when born so maybe I'm just still stretched out? But I already feel and look like I'm 5-6 months pregnant. I had to announce it early already because I look so big. I'm pretty sure it's 25% baby and 75% bloat but it's still crazy that I can feel firm uterus at all!

302,"I feel like I've been pregnant forever but I have a long road ahead. I am only 25 weeks pregnant and while I had some second trimester insomnia before, I am now dealing with insomnia PLUS increasing physical discomfort. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter what, I can't get comfortable. My legs hurt whether straight or bent. My feet ache? My back hurts. My hips hurt. And my belly feels weird when I lie on my side. I also feel like my head is heavy always and my neck hurts. 

So, every time I switch sides or have to get in/out of bed to pee, I have to stuff blankets under my belly, between my knees (and thighs now), between my feet, one behind me to hold my back up, blanket under my neck to support it, and I make a huge commotion in bed trying to do this several times a night. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is patient but he is on a very early schedule for his job and I disrupt him every night. The first time I woke him up last night he said ""are you ok sweetheart""? The second time he woke up in a panic and checked his phone, ""oh, only 12:30, I thought it was 4"". The third time he said crossly ""should I just sleep on the couch now?"" And that makes me feel all teary because it's late and I'm tired and frustrated. So on top of feeling the overwhelming urge to adjust myself, I now feel guilty. This results in me forcing myself to only make one movement a minute (or going really slow, like undoing velcro quietly) and it's PAINFUL, just hoping the next movement won't wake him up and piss him off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried a body pillow for a few weeks, but it took up SO much of the bed. My husband goes to bed first so by the time I got into bed, it was pushed so that I only had 1/4 of the bed left. He'd move but the next time he rolled over in his sleep it would be a weight pushing against me. I finally ditched it and that really helped. So obviously a pregnancy pillow wouldn't be a good option because that's like 2x bigger than a body pillow! 

I replaced my regular pillows with nice ones and that helped a little too. But I still am restless trying to solve the plethora of discomforts. I don't know what to do to make the process easier on both of us. I know it's only gonna get harder with the long 15 weeks ahead.

It seems like on this sub moms that are about as far along as me are always talking about their baby kicking them constantly, all day and night, to the point where it hurts them. That just doesn‚Äôt happen with my baby. He‚Äôs never kicked hard enough to hurt me. I do feel him here and there throughout the day, the occasional hard jab or two, a little rolling, or some little thumps in my belly. But it‚Äôs not even close to constant and it‚Äôs not often hard enough to really grab my attention. 

I started this pregnancy pretty skinny so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs extra weight acting as a buffer, although I‚Äôve gained 25 lbs already people still say I don‚Äôt even really look pregnant yet. With a slightly loose fitting shirt no one would suspect it. But maybe the extra weight I‚Äôve put on does have something to do with it. At my last appointment my fundal height measured a little small so they did an ultrasound and baby is measuring good and my fluid is also fine, they said it was possible I measured small because of the position that the baby was in and me being a small framed person. 

I just don‚Äôt know, and I constantly feel nervous when I think about it or when I haven‚Äôt felt him in a while. My stomach has been a little upset, like feeling very bloated and I‚Äôve been a little constipated and just feeling overly full so I‚Äôm not sure if that could make baby movement less detectable. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs ok to not feel him all the time, what is normal for others, and how little movement is too little. ",Baby doesn‚Äôt move all that much?,1

I'm 10 + 1 day - a newbie! and so far I've been relatively lucky in that my all-day nausea hasn't caused much vomiting. However...yesterday I was struck with the migraine from hell. I've had migraines before - this was some next-level shit. I was dizzy, nauseous, in intense throbbing pain, and could only manage to lay in the dark with an ice pack on my head moaning randomly when my husband asked to help.

Of course, Tylenol wasn't cutting it, and I felt guilty even taking that. I went to bed at 6 pm and woke up periodically to stumble to the washroom.

This evening when they removed the cervidil they had to give me fentanyl just to be able to check my cervix because it hurt SO. FUCKING. BAD. I had made it to one centimetre dilated, but my cervix was still pretty hard. My OB said because of the extreme sensitivity of my cervix she wasn't comfortable going any further with the induction because it was just going to make it hurt worse (it was bleeding as well), and it wasn't even nearly soft enough to start the oxytocin to try and begin labour.

I don‚Äôt really have anyone to help take care of me when the symptoms get hard. 

I‚Äôm SO hormonal and crazy. I miss my mom so bad. 

I‚Äôve had a hard time finding the energy to keep up with my usual workouts during this first trimester and it‚Äôs starting to really affect my body-image already. I‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôs going to happen to my body. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll be too hard for me to learn to love my body again. 

I‚Äôm just... scared, and I feel like I‚Äôm in the dark. I want to do the best for my child. 

If anyone has any advice or tips/tricks to help me through this, I‚Äôd so appreciate it. Even just being told the truth about what to expect about certain stuff most people don‚Äôt think about. 

Thank you.

346,"Hi ! Completely unsure if this is the sub for this type of question so if it‚Äôs not feel free to take it down Mods. Also on Mobile so formatting may be shitty. 

So I‚Äôm 23 weeks pregnant and it has been a saga. I mean from BD drama to Family Drama to Health Crisis‚Äô it‚Äôs all been a little crazy. All in all it‚Äôs been a better experience than most. 

Well there is some drama that has sort of taken a back seat to the rest of these issues because it hasn‚Äôt been too serious and until recently I felt as though I was being a little too sensitive. 

I have a friend (for abbreviation purposes I will call her Alex, obviously this is not her real name.) Alex and I became friends maybe around a year ago. I knew she didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends but chalked it up to her relationship that she had been in for 5 years. Alex is very sweet, kind, and generous. She sometimes says things to rub people the wrong way, but she‚Äôs not really one for terminology so it‚Äôs mostly brushed off by me. 

My real frustration began the moment I found out I was pregnant. I took the test at her house because I had a yeast infection and was a week late. The pregnancy test clearly had that extra line but Alex stated ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not, let‚Äôs wait till tomorrow morning to take a second test.‚Äù I was shaking all night and crying. I woke up at 5 am and took the second test. Pregnant. Alex told me to not tell her the results she was too tired and didn‚Äôt want to deal with the drama. (I mean I get it). I left and bought two digital tests. After I marked them as my territory Alex took them from me. She wouldn‚Äôt let me see them and this was irksome. She looked at them gasped with glee  and gave them to me. Surprise surprise-Pregnant. 

Immediately she said ‚ÄúWell we have to abort so just don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù (So why was she gleeful?) And immediately started planning how to extort the father for more money than the abortion actually cost. I would have been more annoyed and upset had my ears not had the ringing akin to the opening of ABC‚ÄôS hit show ‚ÄúLost‚Äù. 

The next day I was moving and Alex came to help me out. In the middle of moving we sat down and she starts saying how fatigued she feels and says, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm pregnant‚Äù and goes down a list of possible fathers and how they would all love to have trapped her. 

Now my irk level is at a medium so I go buy her tests after an hour because no way in hell am I going to listen to this AND my inner catholic guilt screaming ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A LIFE YOUR CARRYING/ SOME WOMEN WOULD KILL TO BE PREGNANT‚Äù  every ten seconds.  

She takes the test. She is not pregnant. Alex rolls her eyes- then says ‚Äúokay I‚Äôll let you have your thunder.‚Äù 

I was so stunned! I mean I hope you can tell by now I was in a very difficult spot and very scared and I can‚Äôt even put in to words how her callousness effected me. 

Now I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood to explore my options but it wasn‚Äôt for another 7 days. So for 7 days I was a wreck dealing with inner turmoil. Some of the pearls of wisdom Alex decided to drop me included: 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be a loser and having a baby will make you a loser.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThink about it. After having the baby how will you even take care of it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou got me on the no condom hype.‚Äù (My partner and I have been together for two years somewhat on and off. And no this doesn‚Äôt excuse my idiocy. But I firmly reminded her that the minute I found out she was practicing unsafe sex we marched straight to PP to get her condoms) ‚Äúwell I was just following your example‚Äù was her retort. 

I can‚Äôt remember all the sage advice I was given by someone who was clearly uneducated about my situation but clearly it was groundbreaking. 
But I do remember thinking ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you let me answer any of your questions instead of just berating me.‚Äù

During this time she was begging to come to the abortion so she could ‚Äúbe there for me‚Äù. I tried to state calmly that this was going to be a very very emotional thing for me and that I didn‚Äôt want anyone but the father there. She pouted a lot about this. 

Anyway the answer for me was clear. I was going to keep the baby.

She judged me. I can‚Äôt fault her. Most of my friends judged me. Honestly I was judging me. 

But since I‚Äôve decided to keep the baby. The meter of irksome has gone from occasionally medium to an all time high. 

The first issue being my BD. Alex has mentioned at least 29 times that she wants to meet my BD. BD and I are going through such an intense time right now that when we do get together we need to just be alone and process things. She has complained frequently not just to me but to my family and other friends. She becomes incredibly upset when she finds out other friends have met him. But we‚Äôve been together 2 years of course some of my friends have met him!! This just...rubs me the wrong way. 

The second issue being my health and how I treat my body. Since finding out I‚Äôm pregnant I have cut out everything that one possibly should. But Alex continually tells me how to act. To take my pre natals and to eat healthy. Sometimes I will find a guy cute and joke around saying ‚Äúoh I‚Äôd like to climb him!‚Äù And she goes ‚ÄúNOT WHILE YOUR PREGNANT‚Äù  I mean ew I don‚Äôt really want to ! But for principle I remind her that it‚Äôs my body and I will make my own choices. 

Third issue is basically all encompassing anything medical. Alex is furious she has not been invited to any appointments as she has been with me from the beginning of this pregnancy. Going so far as to ask me to at least FaceTime her during ultrasound so she can be there to find out the gender too. BD told me no and I was more than happy to say ‚Äúdarn ! Sorry!‚Äù 
At 20 weeks I had to get emergency surgery. While in the ER whenever I wasn‚Äôt responding to her she was texting my BD.
Later she said ‚ÄúI really have to say it was very nice of me to give BD my spot and not come sit with you. He didn‚Äôt text me for 5 hours I was so annoyed !‚Äù 
When she came to visit me in the hospital she stayed for 5 HOURS. And tried to tell my friend Janie(fake name) to get out of my bed so she could lay with me.


She has also begged me. At least 25 times to be in the room while I give birth. I‚Äôve told her no. That I feel very uncomfortable and this needs to be a moment I experience with BD and my mom with possibly his mom as well.  She visibly rolls her eyes and says fine she‚Äôll be out in the waiting room. Even going so far as to say ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôll switch out with BD.‚Äù 
So...Uhm ... yeah. 



Other things that have happened/ been said. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to swaddle the baby and walk around with her.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf your baby is bad I‚Äôll pinch them and tell them straight up no!‚Äù

‚ÄúBD may have got you pregnant but I‚Äôm more involved than he is and so I should be the one in the room.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWill you let me co sleep with baby and feed her?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou better just breast feed her otherwise baby will end up malnourished. ‚Äú 
(I will feed my baby however i need to feed my baby.) 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll sleep with BD that way he‚Äôll have to be involved‚Äù. (I think it‚Äôs been proven sex will not keep BD around and she said it mostly joking) 

Yesterday she took a pregnancy test and when I asked her about IUD she said she took it out ... like WHAT IS GOING ON. 

Idk am I overreacting? Am I being sensitive? Should I try to place boundaries or should I just go NC. I feel incredibly uncomfortable right now and would appreciate some guidance. Thank you in advance. 

TL;DR : my friend is really overstepping boundaries during my pregnancy and I don‚Äôt know if I should place boundaries or just run away.

347,"Whoops this turned into a real long post/rant! As my title suggests I‚Äôm looking for advice on dealing with in-laws of a different culture who have some intense opinions. 

I‚Äôm a basic white girl and my husband is a first generation American. We are so thankful for his Nigerian culture and plan to honor this in our children‚Äôs lives. Unfortunately, like many first gens we know, there can be a gap between how his parents see things through their cultural lens and how he and his siblings do things. This has come up several times during our relationship but my husband is firm in where he stands and handles these instances well. I thought I was braced for it in regards to our baby, but man was I wrong.

We are first time parents and this baby will be the first grandchild for both sides of the family. My husband‚Äôs brother and sister-in-law have had multiple losses and there has been significant pressure from my in-laws for us to get pregnant. Now that we are pregnant it only took one trimester for them to find fault with us... 
Last week at 14 weeks we posted a public pregnancy announcement. Those close to us had been told in person and I‚Äôm really starting to show so we joyously went for it! Unfortunately, my in-laws were very upset that we shared publicly that we‚Äôre expecting.  My sister in-law is now also pregnant (yay!) and they took out their anger with us on them. They wanted them to confront us for them and have also forbidden them to ever post about their rainbow baby. The only reason they could give as to why pregnancy shouldn‚Äôt be announced was that others would ‚Äústeal our joy‚Äù and haters would essentially wish us harm. For people who preach such a strong faith it feels like some wildly superstitious bull shit. Ironically the only people stealing our joy now are them and I am dreading awkward Christmas interactions. Plus I‚Äôm pissed they would try to deny my sister-in-law something she has looked forward to for so long!

I‚Äôm sure this will be the first of many times they disapprove of our choices and it feels very overwhelming.

I have 1 child with my ex. I didn‚Äôt plan for us not to work out, obviously, but it is what it is. My kid is only 1. I planned to have at least 3 kids and I‚Äôm sorta mourning the future I thought I had. We‚Äôre great parents, just not good together and I‚Äôm still working on accepting that. 

But, in the spirit of wanting my kid to have siblings, considering I‚Äôm knocking on 30 and not even close to being ready to date again, I thought‚Äîwhy don‚Äôt we just have another baby? We‚Äôve discussed it. He also doesn‚Äôt want our kid to grow up as an only child. But is this a totally fucked idea? Should I care about having to explain to family and friends who know we‚Äôve split? Or do I just care that my kid isn‚Äôt an only child and we‚Äôre two coparenting adults? We already have to coparent so why not? Right??

 I mean, I shouldn‚Äôt be so forward thinking but who‚Äôs to say I‚Äôll even meet someone else in any reasonable timeframe to even discuss having children?

My wife is approximately ~10-11 weeks pregnant.  She's been feeling awful, morning sickness 24/7, no appetitie - just horrible.

She made an appointment with her doc and just got out.  The doc has stated that she has a fibroid (approx 3cm) growing out of her uterus.  This is something that he didn't notice when she visited approximately 3 weeks ago.

He's stated that if she was not pregnant, this is something that he would handle, but because she is pregnant, she has been referred to a pelvic surgeon/specialist - and I believe they want to operate - as it's grown to this size in a matter of weeks.

My wife has no previous history of fibroids, visits gyno regularly, etc.

She did however, have very heavy periods after coming off of birth control - is this indicative of fibroids? - potentially fibroids that were missed by previous gyno appointments?

I woke up on Wednesday feeling something coming out of my vagina and went to the bathroom to find out that my panties were all wet and when I removed my clothes I realized that I was still loosing a tiny bit of liquid. I didn't smell like urine and it seemed like amniotic fluid (it was see through and it kiiiiinda smelled like semen, but I may be wrong), so I went to the hospital. There they checked me out twice and I was not leaking amniotic fluid and the test they did with a pantyliner also found no traces of it. The doctors told me it was just urine and I came home feeling very embarrassed.

I slept with an incontinence pad tonight and it was wet in the morning. I'm on my second pantyliner since I woke up (it's 2PM where I live).

I speak several languages, even owned my own company at one point but now I feel very professionally insecure as I go forward having this baby and hopefully a couple more. 

Will this gap in my resume ever be explainable? What if I actually enjoy motherhood and want another kid rather than going right into finding a job? Is mom bias real? Do I just want professional validation? 

I was wondering if any of you ladies out there had any advice about how being a mom and having kids changed professional outlook? Or just any encouragement to move through this time. 

Thank you so much!",Will I ever get a job after being a mother?,1
379,"My twins came at 27+5 September 13th. At the time I considered doing my birth story but I had such a long NICU stay ahead I figured I'd wait. My babies are home now, after 82 days, and I feel I need to tell my story to hopefully keep others from going through the same thing I did.

If you look at my post history you'll see I lost my mucus plug at 24 weeks after a completely normal and healthy pregnancy. I went to L&amp;D, was 2cm dilated from the outside, closed and 7cm long on the inside. I got my shots and mag and was sent home. I went to my OB 2 days later and he did not check my cervix, said 7cm is crazy long and I'm fine.

25 weeks and I'm spotting. Call my OB, 'it's fine'. Having no contractions but other strange symptoms. I was getting weird feelings in my vagina. I was having more discharge than normal and was losing more of my plug. Something was wrong, I felt it, I knew it. I was having discomfort in my belly, discomfort in my pelvis. Anyone having twins knows...twin pregnancies suck. ALL of my feelings were 'completely normal' for twins, no reason to check my super long cervix.

At 27 weeks I went in to my MFM for my 1st appointment. Yes...I had my FIRST MFM appointment at 27 weeks... He decided to check my cervix since I had had issues beforehand. I was 100% effaced, 8cm dilated, with bulging waters. I wasn't leaving the hospital without these babies. The next morning I went in for an emergency csection and my babies were evacd to a hospital over an hour away that could take care of them, I wouldn't have been able to make the ambulance trip without going into labor. I spent my 1st night in the recovery ward listening to all the other moms with their new babies not knowing if mine would survive the night.

The on call OB found one of my placentas had detached. I could have lost my Baby A, probably my Baby B, and even likely my own life if I hadn't had that appointment that day. My OB was extremely apologetic and said my birth story was now the talk of the entire hospital system, apparently that would make me feel better...

After 82 hard days in the NICU my twins came home, perfectly happy and healthy. I was so lucky on all fronts.

If you feel something is off you HAVE to push. Push for yourself, push for your babies. Don't take no for an answer, don't be brushed off. You know your body, you know when something doesn't feel right. I could write a novel about my NICU stay. I know more about premature infants and their care than anyone ever should. No one should have to go through the hell I went through if at all possible. 

Thankfully the brain is amazing, and since I've gotten home with my twins I don't even remember the stresses of the NICU, but I was still robbed of a normal pregnancy. I am forever changed by my time there, and that's not something my OB or anyone else can give back to me. ",Birth Story - 82 day NICU stay and why you should always trust your instincts,1

388,"Just adding my story as I loved reading home birth stories while pregnant.

My midwife wasn‚Äôt epidural certified, but I liked her at our first meeting so I decided to trust her philosophy and go with a home birth or birthing centre. 

Ina May‚Äôs book then convinced me to try a home birth.

My family were a bit concerned that it wouldn‚Äôt be safe, but after I told them that we‚Äôd have the same technology at a home birth as at a birthing centre they relaxed a lot. 

Plus, I resonated with the idea of being able to birth exactly how my instincts were guiding me. I wanted the freedom to be anywhere, to change what I wanted... I knew that if I was in someone else‚Äôs space I would shut down my own instincts because I‚Äôm such a people pleaser.

Anyway, it all went so well. Mucus showed that morning, by 4:30 contractions started, at midnight they started getting hard to talk through, at 2 I started transitioning and my waters broke, and at 4am she was born.

I was in the bath from about 1am and gave birth there too. It felt hard but not impossible. It was like a horrible yoga class... when you find a position really tough to stay in, but know that it will just be a few seconds more before you can relax each time!

My biggest surprise was how self contained I needed to be. I adore my husband and love holding him, and yet I didn‚Äôt want to be talked to or touched at all. I felt embarrassed at how I was almost ignoring him... all my energy was going towards communicating with the baby inside me.

I‚Äôd read two hypnobirthing books but am not sure how helpful they were. What worked for me was sending love inwards. With each contraction I mentally told my baby that I was giving her the biggest hug. Just imagining it as a hug instantly made a contraction feel less intense... it was amazing. I kept telling her mentally how proud I was of her... how brave she was being... how well she was doing.

I had this intense feeling that I needed to make our daughter feel safe and reassured. Birth was already scary enough for her... she needed me to be quiet and calm and loving.

In the end I was surprised at how easy birth was!

Other things that might have helped the birth:

Eating 7 dates daily in the last two months (research backed!)
Walking 10,000 steps daily during pregnancy
Doing a daily squatting routine with hand weights to stay strong. This helped a lot as my preferred birth position ended up being this weird forward leaning frog like squat. :)",Birth story: planned home birth,1

397,"I'm just putting this out there to say that I am a mom to a 6 month old that loves the changing table. When I was pregnant, everyone told me that the table was optional, I wouldn't use it, ect. I set up my changing table despite all these and also made diaper changing areas all over the house. I think I changed my kid's diaper once on my own bed and found it to be too low and was also worried about pee, and i never used a single other ""diaper station"". 

I enjoyed having a home base, I enjoyed having my supplies at hand. I made the changing table cozy by putting up a ""head board"" for my kid to look at and it was one of the first things he really noticed and studied, aside from me and my husband. I also honestly believe his diaper changes were calmer because they were always ""the same."" 

At 7 weeks, we moved to a 2 story house and his changing station went up first (he was still in a bassinet so I didn't worry about the crib) and I also put up the headboard. I have walked upstairs for every single diaper change. I thought for sure I'd finally ""hate"" my changing table once it was upstairs.

Now my kid is moving and grooving. He kicks and shuffles and rolls constantly, but he's still on the table. He might eventually become distracted but diaper changes are calm. And I still have it organized with everything I need. 

It's one of those things that I was constantly told not to bother with and everyone was wrong. My best friend is about to have a baby and she told me she was nervous about not having a changing station, but everyone told her not to get one. I told her it was BS, so now I'm telling you.

I explained to him that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with an episiotomy or the epidural and he replied that he was a doctor and knew what was best. He delivered my cousin vaginally and left my aunt with a horrible scar and permanent nerve damage from her episiotomy(this was 14 years ago) and she told em to avoid getting one unless absolutely necessary. I had wanted to labor in a squatting position to reduce the chance of tearing and due to a genetic disorder, I have an increased risk of paralysis from the epidural so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking that risk.

First time poster here on mobile. 
I‚Äôm currently 36 weeks along, and a first time mom. As of right now I‚Äôm feeling really lightheaded/dizzy, and was just hit with fatigue. I feel like I could faint. I went to the doctor yesterday, and my blood pressure was normal, but the doctor said I was 1 cm dilated. 
Has anyone experienced this before? How did you handle it? Any advice? 

Also, side question for all you lovely moms out there, how long did it take you to go into labor after you were told you were 1 cm dilated, and when were you told you were? Should I expect some rapid progress here shortly or do you guys think otherwise? Any advice on this as well?

428,"Hey! I'm due next month, and my hospital offers the following options for pain relief: epidural, Nubain and Morphine. 

I do not plan on getting the epidural, as I'd like to be able to walk, and the idea of being numb kinda freaks me out.  Initially I was planning on going completely unmedicated, but I don't see any reason to be in an unnecessary amount of pain if it ruins the experience for me.  So, I'm thinking about the narcotic options.  

I've never used Nubain, but I'm told one of the side effects can be a feeling of unwellness or unhappiness.  That is definitely not something I want to be feeling during my birth. 

I have been on morphine (low doses in the hospital) and found it pretty pleasant.  It takes the edge off my pain and allows me to focus on other things, but I remain in control of my body, I can remember everything just fine, and I feel comfortable making decisions.  If anything I feel a little silly, in a good mood.  My only concern is that it can cause respiratory depression in my baby.  I really don't know how big of a deal that might be honestly, or what the implications might be.  I plan on only using small doses, but I have no idea what kind of risk I'd be taking.  

I do plan on discussing this with my doctor at my next appointment, but I think he is really going to push me to get the epidural.  I've been told by another recent mom who had him, that he doesn't like when his patients refuse the epidural (""because he hates seeing them in pain""). When I brought it up early in my pregnancy, he kinda laughed like ""you'll change your mind, they always do"".  

I'd love to hear about your experience with Morphine or Nubain, and if your baby faced any issues as a result.

Edit: Great responses for far. I do wanna add that I think I'm more likely to go unmedicated than receive the epidural, but I will keep an open mind. ",Any experiences with morphine during labor?,1
429,"Hi Bumpers!

I've been working my way through the audiobook version of 'The Science of Mom' and it reminds me a lot of 'Expecting Better' in terms of being a general scientific literature review while still giving general recommendations, yet also outlining what areas are more about personal choice/balancing values and risk. It has a similarly unpatronising tone and covers birth and the first year of baby's life: cord clamping, breastfeeding, formula, vaccinations, sleep training/habits, introducing solid foods, etc.

The author I think also mentions she has a blog, but that's up to you if you want to go find it. I'm not affiliated with it in any way btw, it just reminded me so much of 'Expecting Better' but covered the next stage, so to speak, and I thought some of you might also be interested!

Feel free to post any similar books if you have recommendations of your own. Personally, I like to know the stats/studies and make my own call, even if 'my own call' ends up being pretty standard!

All the best for y'all and your bumps!

Currently 14 weeks &amp; recently learned I have an anterior placenta. My OB said it would take longer for me to feel baby move. Being incredibly impatient, I was not jazzed with this.

Since the placenta is near my bellybutton, I understand baby would be kicking a cushion, which is why I may not feel it from the outside until it‚Äôs bigger (20-25 weeks).

My question is....will the anterior placenta prevent me from feeling baby wiggle/turn until later, too? I just don‚Äôt see how it would impact what I feel from the inside?

441,"OK, so long story short, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in June after several months of bouncing around to a few different doctors (the first couple of which tested my TSH only, which at the time was 3.6-4.1, and assured me I was fine - sigh). My third doctor was recommended by a good friend of mine who was diagnosed with Hashimoto's a couple months before me. The doctor is a GP who actually has a background in midwifery. She's not an endocrinologist but she seems to understand thyroid issues more than many and she has been very successfully treating my friend (whose situation was faaaaar worse than mine -- she went in with a TSH of freaking 91 and antibodies in the thousands).

I've always been slightly hypothyroid but not crazily so, and my doctor was comfortable with me trying some lifestyle changes to improve my numbers, which worked -- they aren't perfect but they're better. I was supplementing my vitamin D which was deficient as well as my iron which was very low, and I went gluten free after my diagnosis.

Anyways, I get pregnant in early November -- my husband and I were NTNP (not trying, not preventing) and got pregnant on our fourth month. I had my thyroid numbers checked just about a week after I found out -- my free T3 was 3.0, free T4 was 1.1, TSH was 2.7, and antibodies were at 178 (down from 278 in June). 

My GP was unconcerned about my numbers and told me I should be all set. My OBGYN is aware of my numbers and told me that my TSH is the tiniest bit higher than optimal (2.5) for first trimester but she's not worried. She recommended re-testing at 12 weeks because ""the HCG (pregnancy hormone) molecule can mimic the thyroglobulin molecule. Typically this regulates around 12 weeks and lab results are more accurate at that time."" (so that's 3 weeks from now -- it's been almost 4 weeks since I had a full thyroid panel).

Should I be pushing to have blood work done sooner? Thyroid stuff is so confusing because I know that not all doctors are well versed in it or the best things to do (as shown by two doctors in a row who dismissed my high-ish TSH without thinking it warranted any further investigation). I want to feel confident that neither doctor feels it necessary for me to be on medication but I am so worried about something happening to the baby as a result. I found a doctor who is fairly new to the area (already established in another state) and she specializes in women's thyroid health and reproductive endocrinology, but she doesn't take insurance, so it'd be a few hundred dollars at least to see her. I don't think it's necessary to see someone else (I am not planning to see my GP throughout the pregnancy), but I'm worried that my OBGYN could be missing something. This third doctor took a look at my numbers as well and concurred that she is not concerned either, that I am borderline and just need monitoring, but... I don't know, maybe I'm just having trouble letting go of the worry.

Sorry for the ramble, I am just... highly stressed about this and unsure what to do!","Anyone more experienced with Hashimoto's, I'd love your feedback/comfort!",1

We had some trouble with trust since the start but there was never any proof of an affair so I let it go. The trust issue came from him dating some one else at work at the same time as he was dating me before we were even exclusive so that's why I let it go. 
Well, he wanted to get married and told me so when I was about 3 or 4 months into my pregnancy. I agreed because we were so happy waiting for our little guy (it's a boy). So we got married exactly 2 months ago on October when I was 6 months in. Prior to the ceremony, we hadn't had sex at all for a couple of months. I figured he felt weird because of the baby and didn't say much about it I thought maybe he'll make an exception the day of the wedding. Well, a month past that we were married and nothing. Not even a french kiss.
I then really said something because I'm sure many of you know what hormones do to you. I was starting to feel gross, ugly, undesirable. He assured me he was pretty much still attracted to me. He just didn't want to make me uncomfortable because the last time we did it I said that having sex was getting a little uncomfortable. Well, another week or two past and still nothing. Then it finally did. With the lights off. I was obviously still hurt because it felt like an obligation for him. That was probably a month ago or a little less. When I talked to him about it I told him I was scared he was getting satisfaction somewhere else and that's why he didn't even try to touch me. Oh boy I was so right.
Yesterday, I grabbed an old phone of his because mine's battery was failing. However, since I already had my doubts I didn't mention that I took it. I just set it under my pillow and let it charge while he left for work. He left. I turned it on and he was still connected to his facebook account. I've never been the kind of person who's that paranoid and goes through someone else's personal stuff, but I needed to reassure myself. What I found was a conversation with a girl he went to elementary school with. It was the third conversation on his messenger. First was mine, second a group with his friends and then hers. The latest message was from that morning saying ""Buenos dias mi amor."" Meaning good morning my love. We both speak Spanish. He send that while I was getting his breakfast ready to go because he had a long commute to work. 
I went through the while conversation. They were sending each other nasty texts. They both knew they were both married to other people. She knew I was pregnant. There were videos and photos of her fingering herself and him telling her he wanted to finish on top of her and whatnot. The oldest text was from the day he came home at 5 am. It was the day he and his old pals from elementary got together. He was insisting she should be there and sending her the address. Based on the messages I'm sure she didn't show and they didn't see each other that day. However, there was obviously a whole conversation erased before those messages. 
I took all the screenshots I seemed necessary and send them to the girl's husband. They were pretty explicit and he still chose to believe her. Whatever, that's their marriage. I did my civil duty by letting him know. The guy however told me they called my husband and he denied me. He said he didn't know me and that his wife's name was Miriam. Obviously, that's not my name. 
It later occurred to me that if he had done something with this girl he would've told one specific friend. So I went through that conversation as well. There was not mention of this girl. There was however a mention of another one he did manage to sleep with. They slept together 2 weeks ago. On my favorite cousin's birthday. It was a random local porn star. So it was pretty obvious he just went to get laid and came back. As there was only a two hour gap between the ""cover for me"" text to the ""guess who I fucked"" text. 
I also went a little further into the conversations and  found he was trying to get into this other girl's pants but she didn't seemed interested at all. Those were from back in July when we were still having regular sex as I was only two months or three pregnant. 
And now I'm devastated. I feel like such an idiot for allowing such a piece of shit to be the father of my child. My first child. I'm more convinced that ever that he just married me because his father wanted him to respond to me. 
I left with all my things and my unborn child's things the same day I found out and came back to my parents' house. I've had an infection since the very beginning of my pregnancy and now I can't stop thinking it may not be going away because he kept getting infections from sleeping around and not caring about my health or the baby's. 
As soon as I told him I was leaving he started saying he'd leave facebook and all his social media of that's what it took to not lose his wife and kid. I laughed and say sarcastically ""oh well let me stay then."" He realized soon that there was no way I was staying with him or forgiving him and started begging I did not take his child away from him. I told him it was still 7 weeks for him to be born, assuming this little episode doesn't affect me that much and I go into preterm labor, and that we'd talk about it when he was born. As of right now, I do not want him near me in the delivery room. I don't want anyone letting him know I'm in labor when the time comes. 
I'm not a monster, I'll obviously allow him to be a part of the baby's life. However, I don't think it's necessary for him to be a part of mine as of right now. He doesn't need to see the baby being born to be a dad to him. He missed that chance when he decided getting laid was more important than having a family. It might sound like I'm trying to get revenge. And maybe a part of me is but I mostly want to be with people that actually care about me while I'm doing the most difficult thing I'll probably do in my whole life. 
Thank you for all of you who read the whole thing. I just needed to let it out.

I'm super distracted when the food arrives and so I start chomping it down, eating the cod on top first, then the layer of vegetables at the bottom of the plate. I took a first bite of the vegetables, swallowed, took a second bite, and then realized.. wait is this *romaine*?!? Spat out bite #2. Now I'm freaking out because of the E Coli recall. :(

I called and the F&amp;B manager said this was little gem lettuce, which initially brings me comfort, until I realize that little gem lettuce is just a smaller variety of romaine lettuce. I ask where the lettuce was harvested, and it's from Salinas, CA, which is in the Central Californian region, which the CDC continues to recommend [avoiding](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/12/07/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-safe-eat-lettuce-yet/2236953002/).

Just popping in to share our nursery-less set up! 

Earlier this year my husband and I moved into a new temporary home - it's much smaller than we're used to, but for 12 months we'll manage. This house has 1.5 bedrooms; a master and a very small office. The small space is nice because we cannot easily host any guests, which means that anybody coming to see the baby will have to stay elsewhere - yay! The downside is that we don't have a nursery - but that's okay, we don't *need* one. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in lieu of a nursery we have baby areas scattered around the house:

1) Pack 'n' Play w/bassinet in the master bedroom

2) Changing pad on a desk in the hallway (it is as awkward as it sounds - but no other option)

3) Chrome carts ([link to carts](https://www.amazon.com/Honey-Can-Do-CRT-01451-Rolling-Utility-Chrome/dp/B0041RRPCY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544555767&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=honey+do+chrome+cart&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ladyjupiter-20&amp;linkId=67c94326e6cebd777c3ded7f83746afb&amp;language=en_US)) for daily baby things; clothes, diapers, blankets, etcetera

&amp;#x200B;

I've been really happy with the carts -we use them for different things each time we move. Now almost all of baby's things are contained in these same carts within felt bins ([link to felt bins](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073SNGMBY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ladyjupiter-20&amp;linkId=8cee75945a31e0c85406b996da1152e0&amp;language=en_US))! Baby items that we won't use in this house (like 12m clothes, and sippy cups) are in a partially transparent Dimpa storage bag from IKEA ([link to Dimpa](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10056770/?query=DIMPA+Storage+bag)). So they're at least in one place, and easy to grab and sort through. Even though we don't have a room for baby things, at least I can keep things tidy in a tiny house.  


I look forward to setting up a real nursery (or at least really unpacking!) after we move again.

Hi /r/babybumps,

Just a huge bittersweet and grateful thank you. Over the weekend, I posted under a throwaway account about scary pregnancy developments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/a4lyl7/9w_but_experiencing_cramping_and_bleeding_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/a4lyl7/9w_but_experiencing_cramping_and_bleeding_just/)

We'd begun to see bleeding and cramping, and since we hadn't yet announced to family and friends, I was feeling very anxious and lonely and reached out to this tremendously supportive community. Unfortunately, while we were hoping it would turn out benign, my symptoms escalated yesterday morning to the point I had horrific cramping and was passing massive clots - at one point every 10-15 minutes, filling up pads by the hour or sooner.

I knew it wasn't good when we went for ultrasounds and there was no mention of viability from the tech (although held out hope it was only because it was the doctor's role to do so). I knew just before they told us as, originally when the cramps got bad, I'd been given a low dose of morphine with reassurance that ""it wouldn't harm the baby"" and then hours later, they doubled my dose without a word of a baby or risk.

And then our doctor broke the news. There was no heartbeat. Our little ""snowman"", as we'd dubbed him/her from the adorable snowman shape on our sonogram where we heard their beautiful heartbeat for the first time, was gone. Later a nurse would ask first we were at 8 weeks and when we clarified 10, she mentioned apparently our baby didn't look like it had developed much past 8. This was horrendously sad news.

We're absolutely heartbroken. They make matters more painful, we're unsure if I've yet passed the actual fetus and I'm waiting for my body to pass what is left inside me, unsure if I'll see the actual body of our sweet baby (which I go back and forth between wanting to see our fetus for a last time and knowing it will be excruciatingly painful to see what had just begun to form leave my body, deceased). This journey is hell, and there's still nothing to be done for now but wait it through.

But through this, I read the previous post and was so eternally grateful for this community - that you'd rally around a scared internet stranger and share your stories, happy or heartbreaking. You have no idea how much relief it brought me even in our darkest hours and it will continue to be a source of support in our grief journey to come.

Thank you for helping a scared pregnant lady feel so less alone. I cried grateful tears when I first read responses, and I cry sad yet happy tears now for the support I feel from this community.

495,"Baby is due this weekend! Yay! I'm an overprotective first time mom, and requested that family gets the Tdap and flu shot before meeting baby. Everybody was more than willing!

Well, my DH had the conversation with FIL. FIL's exact response was ""I'm not putting that poison in my body. Piss on it."" We haven't heard from him in 3 months. I wasn't there for the conversation, and I don't care to reach out to him.

So obviously he is not invited to meet the baby when he is born. I guess my question is, when would it be safe for him to visit? I'm thinking 3 months at least?

Just some background info: This is his first grandchild. MIL is still married to him, they live together, and she is planning on visiting. She knows he is not invited without the shots, and we talked about it briefly. The entire family is so passive, having any type of meaningful conversation is met with silence, ""I don't care,"" or ""I don't know."" So this is about all the info I have.

If anybody has been through this before, please share your advice! I'm honestly content not making an effort to invite him to meet the baby. I'm just imagining an awkward encounter 6 months later at a family event, like, ""Well...here is your grandchild..."" Ugh!

Edit to add: I'm not looking for reasons for why it's ok not to get the shots. My DH and I did our research and made our decision a while ago.

499,"Sorry this is so long but as a FTM I loved reading these stories. I had hyperemesis throughout my entire pregnancy but was coping very well until the last few weeks when all the other fun symptoms kicked in like heartburn and pelvic pain. My mom had all 3 of her babies 4-6 weeks early and I was constantly measuring small/behind but the docs were convinced my little boy was going to make his appearance early. I had a membrane sweep at 38 weeks and was already at 3 cm with 75% effacement of the cervix. My doc was very surprised by my progress and was sure LO would be out before weeks end. Every night I would go to bed thinking this could be it but every morning I would wake up still pregnant. Another sweep at 39 weeks with the same measurements but no progress. We began to discuss induction dates. I live in a small town so there was only a 2-3 day window after my 40 weeks to do the induction. We settled on the Monday when I would be 40 +5. Well Sunday night I get a call saying they will try one last sweep on the Monday and push my induction to Wednesday if nothing else happens. Ok I got all psyched up for labor and excited to finally meet our precious boy but what's a few more days. Went in at 1 PM for my sweep and was 100% effaced but only 2 cm dialated so back home I go. Had the usual cramping and spotting starting around 2 but didn't think anything of it until at 430 I was having full on contractions every 5-7 minutes for about a minute each. As a FTM I still wasn't completely sure this was the real deal because although it was incredibly painful I was sure it wouldn't stay consistent and I'd have to be induced. Well 1 call to my doc at the hospital and off my husband and I went with no turning back. Admitted at 530 and was already 7 cm dialated! Had my waters broken at 7:30. Began pushing at 9 and my sweet baby boy was born at 10:30 PM after a medial/lateral episiotomy. He turned out to be over 9 lbs! So much for measuring small! No way was his chubby body coming out without a little help. I labored naturally except for when my doc had to cut me. I used the nitrous gas and it worked like a charm as I did not freeze very well and could feel her cutting. Apart from that the whole labor experience was wonderful. The staff was amazing and knew just what to say to keep me motivated and my husband held my leg up the entire time and didn't get queezy once (he's not a fan of blood or medical procedures in general, manly man in the trades lol) Just want to tell all the mommas out there that they can do it!",Birth Story (long but very positive),1

**TL;DR: do not ignore postpartum depression and anxiety, it doesn‚Äôt just go away. It can last for years, and rob you of the joy you deserve to have.**

I was stoked for my first child. He was unplanned but so very wanted. I had extreme postpartum depression and anxiety that nearly destroyed my marriage. I have felt like a failure my whole life, dealt with self doubt and a complete lack of confidence after years of bullying. I decided, if there‚Äôs one thing I will be good at, it will be motherhood! I will give it my all. And I gave too much of myself, honestly. I completely lost myself in motherhood and fell deep into depression.

We went to counseling, I got on medication, I found my hobbies again, I made friends, life got better, and we started trying for our second. 

She was planned and it took about 8-9 months to conceive her. I knew I needed to be put on antidepressants and communicated with my husband about what I needed from him. I needed him to check in with me about if I was taking my meds when I‚Äôm struggling to keep it together. I needed him to help without acting inconvenienced and annoyed if I said I needed a break. I needed reassurance. And I needed to be encouraged to do things that fulfill me as an individual, not as a mom. So it wasn‚Äôt as bad with her. Still some anxiety and depression, but it was mostly manageable.

We began talking about birth control and timing of our next baby. Husband wouldn‚Äôt mind having them close together, I wanted to wait. Before I even made an appointment with my gynecologist to get back on birth control, I missed a period. 6 days late, big fat positive, and my baby was not yet 9 months old. *Fuckkkkk.* This was completely my fault. Totally preventable. I hated myself for being anxious instead of excited. I wished I could have just given the pregnancy to my friend struggling with infertility for 4 years.

I cannot tell you how many times I had dreams that I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, or that I miscarried, and felt relief... or thought about how I would react if the OB tried to find a heartbeat and told me I had lost the baby. I have been in a really dark place this entire pregnancy. 

I was raped when I was 15, and I finally started going to therapy for it in November. I met with my therapist today, and she asked about my due date and stuff, and I just... completely fell apart. I have been praying to have my anxiety lifted and to be excited for this baby, with no luck. So my counseling session that was intended to be about processing and letting go of my rape trauma turned into me inconsolably sobbing to the therapist, about all of my anxiety that I won‚Äôt have the emotional capacity to be a good mother to 3 kids because right now I‚Äôm barely hanging in there with the 2 I‚Äôve got, I suck at managing my depression and anxiety, I suck at asking for help/support, I suck at taking care of myself. I suck at basic things like taking a pill every day and scheduling appointments for my physical and mental health. I told her everything and I bawled the entire time. 

She taught me some techniques that we were going to use anyway for my rape trauma. Grounding techniques for my anxiety, and the ‚Äúcontainer method‚Äù of imagining whatever container I‚Äôd like, big or small, basic or complex, but something I can imagine with enough definition that I can take deep breaths and close my eyes, and imagine storing all of these thoughts and emotions that are overwhelming me, to work on them with her. For me it‚Äôs a giant, industrial quality safe. And also trying to decide on a calm, quiet place for me to imagine myself in when I‚Äôm falling apart. For her it‚Äôs a beach. For me it‚Äôs probably going to be a private library. Bookshelves everywhere, a floor to ceiling window, the smell of old decaying paper, the most comfortable armchair and ottoman ever, and only seating/room for me, no husband or kids allowed. 

Admitting that I‚Äôm terrified of how my life is about to change, and admitting that I feel that I am not emotionally equipped for this, was SO hard. When I say and think about it, it makes me feel like a bad mom. Like my kids and my husband deserve better. It makes me feel sorry for them, that I‚Äôm what they‚Äôve got. Because I know firsthand what it‚Äôs like to grow up with a mom so depressed she was effectively THE stereotype... spending every moment she wasn‚Äôt at work laying in bed watching soap operas, refusing to spend quality time with me or my dad, struggling so much that I literally didn‚Äôt begin to build a relationship with her until I was an adult. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm going to crack and I will turn into that shell of a person. It is so freaking hard to be vulnerable and admit that out loud. But it did help, and I have more hope that this huge life change will be a good one. I feel less doomed, and less like I have doomed my family, because of our careless attitude toward family planning. 

If you know you struggle with depression and anxiety, tell your OBGYN before you give birth. Schedule your 6 week postpartum visit before you even leave the hospital after giving birth, because I avoided it with my first and I regret that I didn‚Äôt go. Open up about your anxiety, and find someone you can trust to tell if you are having an anxiety attack or if you are getting feelings like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad mom, my kid(s) deserve better than me, and I think things would be better for them if I was out of the picture.‚Äù Don‚Äôt just suffer silently and wait for it to go away. Because you might lose everything. I lost months of my son‚Äôs life to my anxiety, I was so strung out that I don‚Äôt remember months at a time. I look at pictures and all I see are fake smiles, and that breaks my heart, I wish I could have taken care of my mental health so those smiles could have been genuine, and so I would have fond memories of those months that I‚Äôll never get back. 

You aren‚Äôt a freak if you don‚Äôt bond with your baby before and/or immediately after birth. You aren‚Äôt a bad mom if you tell a doctor that you‚Äôre miserable and you‚Äôre barely keeping it together. You deserve to enjoy this part of life. Don‚Äôt just let the depression and anxiety decide when you get to have a genuine smile for a photo, or when you get to make good memories with your kid. It sucks to feel that way, but it sucks worse when you do absolutely nothing to try and correct it. Trust me, did that with my first kid and I will forever regret it.

527,"y‚Äôall i just wanna say that i am here purely to bitch about my suffering right now. Buckle up because this is long and I stopped working 5 days ago so I have too much time on my hands now. Feels like I‚Äôm drowning in the styx right now.

I woke up at 6am this morning to some very strong contractions and had lost part of my mucus plug. It was bloody and gross. 

Fianc√© left for work around 7am and I texted him updates throughout the day. I figured by the time he came home around 3pm we might consider heading to the hospital, with how my contractions were going. I thought I was in early labor. Hah. Hahahah. NOPE. Cue prodromal labor that I didn‚Äôt realize was prodromal labor. 

Contractions were consistent and roughly 15 minutes apart at first. Got down to 12 apart at ~35 to 45 seconds long around 9am, with a couple inconsistencies where they were closer together (like 7min apart instead of 12). They were painful as hell. 

They continued to get closer together until around noon, when I almost lost my fucking shit because suddenly they went to 20 minutes apart, still as intense. From there they became super inconsistent (20 minutes apart to 13 minutes apart back to 20 and then randomly would be 5 minutes apart, etc) , and I was so exhausted and upset. I took a nap. 

Fianc√© comes home from work, and my contractions have pretty much fizzled out but I‚Äôm still randomly getting them, and they‚Äôre still hella painful. Just to add, I know it‚Äôs prodromal labor as opposed to BH contractions because my BH contractions are purely pressure with no pain, and I‚Äôd been having them since 33 weeks, no problem. These contractions had me almost crying. 

Anyways, my fianc√© has been putting off getting his flu shot and TDAP for about 3 weeks now. At first it was understandable because he had some issues with insurance and us trying to figure out where he was covered to get his shots. 

Then I literally did everything for him, set up his online insurance portal and got him the card. Literally all he had to do was walk into a CVS clinic, sign forms, wait 10 minutes, and get pricked with both shots at the same time. 

Nope. I had to literally drag him to CVS today while he bitched and whined about being tired at me, his 9 month pregnant cold ridden fianc√©e who‚Äôs been having contractions all damn day. 

I‚Äôm not trying to say he‚Äôs not allowed to be tired or anything but I feel that my day was genuinely significantly worse than his. He had 2 pressure washing jobs with his partner today and mentioned that he slept in the work truck for a few hours of his work day. And god he was being such a man child about everything. Whining about how he doesn‚Äôt like shots. Big fuckin woop buddy, I hate them too but I‚Äôd enjoy not giving our newborn child fucking pertussis.

 I pointed out that this morning both of us thought we‚Äôd have a baby by the end of the night, and his lazy ass had 3 weeks to get this done. He continued to pout about it. Whatever. 

He passed out when we got home and I‚Äôm still having these damn contractions randomly.

It didn‚Äôt work like that and I still struggle a lot with ‚Äúwhat could I have done‚Äù. Know that even if you do everything ‚Äúright‚Äù, sometimes shit happens and it‚Äôs out of your control. I struggle to take my own advice on this. 
I will add the caveat that I would look into workouts that are appropriate for a pregnant body - both from the standpoint of alleviating common complaints and preparing your body for pregnancy. I'll have a recommendation in my recs list. 

* Research the things you think you'll never do. Information is a good thing. For me, I wanted an unmedicated birth - or at least not a c-section. I got halfway there and things went pretty south for me. I ended up with a semi-emergency c/s after 24 hours of labor and FTP. Though from reading birth stories here, I knew at 16 hours in that it would end with a c/s because things had stalled and back labor is the worst. The worst. 
I wish I had done more research on c-sections and some of the things that can go wrong around labor. Of course, I had a number of atypical things happen during my delivery that I probably couldn't have prepared for, but I still wish I had known a bit more. What will recovery look like, saved some resources in case I need them, that type of thing. A lot of times I breezed through the more traumatic or complicated birth stories and thought meh, that won‚Äôt be me so I‚Äôm not going to think too hard on this. Again, it‚Äôs not your fault if things go ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúprepared‚Äù but information is a good thing. Reading through and knowing what the possible complications are and maybe a brief in your head ‚Äì ‚Äúhow would I handle this or how would I want my partner to advocate for me‚Äù could be helpful. 
Bedsharing would be another one. I was 100% totally against this. Only a lazy or uneducated parent would do such an unsafe thing. When we discovered at 8 weeks in that baby wouldn't stay asleep for more than 30 minutes alone but we could get a couple hours next to or on one of us....survival is the goal and sleep is the key. Of course falling asleep upright, babe in arms in a soft and crevicy recliner is a bad idea. Due to issues with gas, I was supposed to keep baby upright for 20-30 minutes post feeding. That‚Äôs a goddamn eternity at 2:30am and more than once I caught myself opening my eyes and realizing 5-10 minutes had passed. Knowing what is safer so at 3am when you‚Äôre desperate you can choose that option and get pillows/blankets out of the way is a good thing. 

* Somewhat contrary to the above, but I wish I had spent less time worrying and more time enjoying. Granted, we had a great big scare early on and it sort of dampened my excitement for the rest of the time. Sort of a waiting for the other shoe to fall type of thing. It's easy to say now, but I wish I had let myself relax and enjoy the pregnancy more. 
* As a counter to ‚Äúbe flexible on things you think you‚Äôll never do‚Äù for those of you shaking your heads that you‚Äôll never bedshare‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶know that  - at least for me ‚Äì despite that ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see/just you wait‚Äù advice, I really did stick to my plans and knew myself best on some things. I didn‚Äôt want hospital visitors or people coming to help post-birth. Didn‚Äôt change my mind post-baby and no regrets on that. Due to the difficult delivery, having visitors would have been too much. It was hard to find time to even sleep in the hospital. Parents did come up to visit within the first couple weekends but it was for daytime only.  Spouse and I sort of secluded ourselves those first weeks and it really helped us grow as a team and get to know our baby. I will add the caveat that my spouse took five weeks of paternity leave. Had he not had that much time off, I may have reconsidered on the ‚Äúno help‚Äù aspect. I also found time to shower and a bit of time for my own interests. In the early weeks, when baby slept all the time, we kept up on housekeeping and cooking pretty well. I even froze a bunch of garden veggies and added to my freezer meal stash! Some of us in our bumper group found that we couldn‚Äôt just let the house ‚Äúgo‚Äù as it made us pretty anxious. So we weren‚Äôt always napping when the baby did. It helped me mentally sometimes to go do things I knew how to do ‚Äì laundry, dishes, garden work. Especially when I was struggling with something I didn‚Äôt know how to do with the baby. 

* You‚Äôll still be you. This was one of my biggest concerns pre baby. Losing any semblance of the person I was and just being someone‚Äôs ‚Äúmom‚Äù. Now, he *is* pretty much the star of my life right now and most conversation revolves around him. But I still feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù, just with this new and awesome person in my life. I still make (limited) time for the other things important to me. I don‚Äôt have as much time for them, they get interrupted a lot more, and some things have fallen off for now (like reading books), but they are still there. I know someday I‚Äôll have more time for them again. Right now, I feel no guilt not getting to my crafting project for yet another night in favor of baby snuggles. 

* Post-baby body. Probably my other biggest concern. It wasn‚Äôt easy early on ‚Äì I had a lot of swelling, an unwanted scar, and hardly recognized myself. It‚Äôs gotten so much better over the past four months. I‚Äôm a lucky one that breastfeeding has helped with the weight loss. I‚Äôve also been working out consistently since six weeks and that has been great for me. Not only from a rebuilding strength/weight loss perspective, and body image, but just feeling like I‚Äôm back in control of my body again. It‚Äôs also a nice bit of time to focus on myself and I swear it gives me more energy to deal with the sleep deprivation. It‚Äôs not always easy to find the time for it, but it‚Äôs a huge priority for me so I sneak it in where I can. Having a supportive partner is a big help. 

* Which brings me to partners for those of you for whom this applies. It‚Äôs hard to say how things will go until you‚Äôre in the middle of it, but you‚Äôll likely have days where one or both of you feel the other isn‚Äôt doing enough. Try to talk ahead of time about how you see things going. One person taking night duty? Or one doing feeding the other burping and back to bed? How will laundry, dishes, cooking, etc. be handled? Try to at least talk through your expectations of each other so you can identify major roadblocks ie. your spouse thinks because you‚Äôre going to breastfeed that you‚Äôll do night wakeups 100% whereas you thought they‚Äôd bring the baby to you and then take for burping + diaper changes. Know that if you have a c/s, the first couple weeks it‚Äôs hard to get up from lying down and get in and out of bed. If you have someone who can bring you the baby ‚Äì even if they‚Äôre just in the PnP next to you ‚Äì you‚Äôll probably want that. Who is carrying the mental load? Are there things your partner handles or is mom expected to know all of it? My spouse fell into the role of being the expert swaddler. That was his thing. He was the expert on the car seat. Stuff like that he did the research on and taught me what I needed. I didn‚Äôt have to put in the time and bandwidth on those things. Stuff will still come up and plans may change but I really think it‚Äôs important to have the conversation. 

* Bumper groups and comparisons. First, your bumper group if you haven‚Äôt joined, is a wealth of information and a ready-made support group. It‚Äôs been so helpful to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.especially scrolling through at 4am seeing who else is up with me. You‚Äôll quickly realize you are not alone in the struggles you have. Along with that though, try not to compare. Oh look, one of the moms has a baby already STTN. That‚Äôs great, you think, green with envy as you‚Äôre up for the 4th time tonight. What you don‚Äôt catch is that she‚Äôs struggling with breastfeeding or has a birth injury causing lots of pain. Everyone has their own successes and their own struggles 

* Baby blues were worst for me around weeks 2-3. Like, crying every evening. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for how much it would impact me. The birth, my body, the life changes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a lot. Know that it‚Äôs normal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.to a degree. Mine passed and I‚Äôm ok now, but never feel hesitant to let your partner in, talk to your doctor, or just air it out to your bumper group. Again, you‚Äôll find you are not alone. 

* Finally for me ‚Äì I was prepared for newborn/infant times to be the worst in terms of sleep deprivation, becoming resentful of my spouse, wishing for my old life, etc. There are days, of course. I still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm now a person who can survive pretty well on 5-7 hours of severely broken sleep, but I can. I definitely pictured this time period to be worse than it has been. Having a supportive partner who is willing to do more than their share at times is a huge key. I actually heard it described as a pendulum vs. 50/50 and I think that is accurate. Some days you need more out of one person.  . Know that so many things baby-related are a phase. Grunty newborn? Phase. Scream crying from 8-10pm? Phase. (typically). Baby taking 15-20 minutes per side? Phase. Screaming in the car seat? Phase (probably), but also check that they aren‚Äôt overheating in it. Pretty much as soon as you learn to deal with whatever you have, they change the rules and move on to something else, lol. 

Of course this may not be the case for everyone but I feel like I went in to this the opposite of rose-colored glasses and it‚Äôs been a bit better than I thought (except for the birth, I went in expecting pain but it was so much worse, again atypical birth experience). Seeing my spouse as a father is just wonderful. It‚Äôs a new facet to him I hadn‚Äôt seen before and just adds to how much I love him. I love this baby ‚Äì I love seeing bits of myself and my husband in him. I love watching him grow and learn. While at the same time being sad that he‚Äôs getting bigger every day. It truly has been worth the sleepless nights for me and my only ‚Äújust you wait‚Äù to all you bumpers is that ‚Äújust you wait‚Äù until you meet your sweet little baby(ies) and get to have their wonderful, sweet, silly selves add so much joy to your lives üòä 

",Hello From the Other Side,1
532,"I was recently approved for Medicaid but only for pregnancy-related coverage. Is anyone in the same boat? I still have BCBS as a primary insurance provider until the end of the year. I'm most likely going to renew since I'll still need coverage for non-pregnancy related issues.

For my OB office, should I list the Medicaid as the primary insurance or do I have to disclose BCBS since I'll still need it for any non-pregnancy related issues?

Tips: For those of you doing registry completion purchases, save one of them (the online one for Target) for post baby. You may discover things you need more of, things that don‚Äôt work for you, etc. For example, I waited to purchase extra pumping parts and supplies until I knew that breastfeeding would work for us. 

Things we have loved:

* Glider rocker &amp; ottoman we had made for us. Not cheap, but worth its weight in gold. It swivels. It rocks. It is extra wide and super cushiony. If I ever leave my husband, I may marry this chair instead. Though he may beat me to it as he loves it too. Tall back so his head can rest against the cushion and he doesn‚Äôt feel crammed in. I‚Äôve spent many a pre-dawn hour in that chair rocking my baby. So has husband. 
* [Pack n play]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PTL3TOO?colid=3ASM1TI1K5JKN&amp;coliid=I1FY1MI3GLM3P8&amp;ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link&amp;th=1)
Nothing fancy, was told by a coworker that they grow out of the napper so quickly + it‚Äôs hard to switch that around so we went with this more basic model. No real complaints. We‚Äôve taken it to friends‚Äô houses and to parents‚Äô houses. Baby sleeps in it next to us still.

* [Rock n play](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NEO5UTU?colid=3ASM1TI1K5JKN&amp;coliid=I1IYF38K8AQP2X&amp;ref=br_ADD_TO_CART_title_link&amp;th=1)
Baby took almost all his early naps in this and was a great baby containment device for the first two months. We never had success with overnight sleep in it but I know many parents have ‚Äì especially those that struggle with reflux. It‚Äôs also a great way to get a shower if you are home alone. I‚Äôd bring it into the bathroom with me and baby would love staring up at the lights/listening to me while I got a shower. Also worked to contain him while I got ready to give him a bath. After his stump fell off, I just gave him a shower with me until he got too big to do this with easily and separate bath time made more sense. 

* [Boppy]( https://www.amazon.com/Boppy-Nursing-Pillow-Positioner-Naked/dp/B000KW5I6E/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544476086&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=boppy+pillow) So useful early on when you‚Äôre trying to establish a good latch and baby is so tiny. Also great for tummy time now. I thought the infant lounger seemed redundant at the time and didn‚Äôt get it but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll get for baby #2. When they are pretty little, the boppy isn‚Äôt a great place to leave the baby because they sink down too easily. The lounger would have been great for that. 
* [Hakaa or similar]( https://www.amazon.com/NatureBond-Silicone-Breastfeeding-Air-Tight-Hardcover/dp/B07GP1Y3VM/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544476195&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=naturebond+silicone+manual+pump)
Also key those early days when the milk runneth everywhere. You attach this to the non-nursing boob to catch letdown. I got a good stash started just from this passive collection. Watch the video on how to attach though Don‚Äôt just squeeze and attach. A well-placed baby kick at 2am will knock two ounces onto the bed into the newly washed sheets. Your husband will snap at you, you will cry, and everything is terrible.* Watch a video on how to properly attach! You flip back the entire top, squeeze, then attach.   *Husband did apologize, was mostly surprised by his 2am milk bath.  Turns out the waterproof mattress pad has use beyond prepping for your water breaking. 

* [Swaddles]( https://www.amazon.com/aden-anais-Swaddle-Blanket-Viscose/dp/B01CDEP4HO/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544476540&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=aden%2Band%2Banais%2Bswaddle%2Bblanket%2Bmuslin&amp;th=1)
These were super great for us in doing the old school swaddle that we used for the first two months. It didn‚Äôt contain baby 100% of the time but worked better than anything else. For that first chunk of time, others would end up riding over his face at night and that was a no-go for me. These are a lighter material for our July baby. When he outgrew these, we moved onto:

It was too much fabric when he was little. What I liked is that it could do arms in, out, or just wrapped around under his arms. It allowed us to transition from the maximum security prison swaddle to probation arms out swaddling without freaking out. We‚Äôve now bought a bigger size and he has it at daycare as well. 

* [Hatch](https://www.amazon.com/Hatch-Baby-Night-Light-Machine/dp/B06XMRCC94/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1544480906&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=hatch) Great nursery nightlight, sound machine - very happy with this. Note that it goes down in volume briefly and comes back up after 12 hours. Your spouse may think you are trying to mess with them. 

* [Yoga ball]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GQMPKY/ref=twister_B078RFTT2L)
For more than working through contractions ;P I got in a lot of hours on this thing through the colicky weeks and beyond. Our baby loooooooved bouncy movement and this was a good way to get it done. It‚Äôs possible I spent some nights with more hours on this than in my bed. Bonus, bouncing on a yoga ball counts toward your Fitbit steps. And it racks up fast. 

* [Nursing tanks]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073JVHLML/ref=twister_B07BN3MLQP) I‚Äôm wearing one of these right now at work. They were great for my summer baby and work perfectly as undershirts now that I‚Äôm back at work pumping. They have some compression to them and a shelf to stick your nursing pads in. I‚Äôll still wear them at night and throw a lightweight jacket overtop to sleep in. 

* [Leakies]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F7WZP3/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) These were great for my maternity leave days + night. I use bamboobies now at work because they are thinner and I‚Äôm not leaking nearly as much now. 

* [Pump bag]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K2AFHA0/ref=twister_B01NCQ8YRW?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1)
This is fancier than what you probably need, but I got a nice discount for getting it at the pharmacy where I bought my pump (Spectra S1). And sometimes it's nice to just have something that looks and feels nice vs the super obvious black pump bag. It holds my laptop and work notebook so it doubles as a nice-looking work bag for me. I‚Äôll probably continue using it after I‚Äôm done pumping because I really like the messenger strap it has. A spot for a water bottle would make it perfect. I also really like the cold gold cooler bag she makes. 

* [Workout program](https://www.expectingandempowered.com/about/) Said I'd link this from my advice thread so editing this in. Working out has been key to my mental wellness and I know finding something that addressed the needs and safety of pregnant/postpartum women wasn't easy and I stumbled into this program shortly after delivery. I've been doing it for three months now and I'm really, really happy with it. Two sisters (one with personal training background, the other is a PT who specializes in women's health) developed it and I feel like I get paid to promote it as often as I bring it up. If nothing else, I encourage you to follow them on Instagram for great tips on helping with common pregnancy/new mom aches and pains. 

Other things not linked  - Bourdeax green butt paste for every day (cloth diaper safe) and A&amp;D for overnight/stubborn diaper rash. And get a little spatula thing! Seems ridiculous but you won‚Äôt want to spend time wiping diaper cream off your hands. Cloth diaper prefolds. Everywhere. I think you can get some as your Amazon baby bucks thing. Do it. Regular burp clothes are cute but they‚Äôre too small! I keep these everywhere  - put them under his head for nursing, near his playmat for spit up, in the diaper bag, by our rocking chair, anywhere we sit with him. 

And a note on freezer meals ‚Äì the energy bites and zucchini muffins I made were the most eaten during my leave. I‚Äôm eating them now as breakfast/snacks. I did a lot of meal prepping but we actually didn‚Äôt touch it while I was on leave. Between spouse and I, we had enough time to make food. However, now that I‚Äôm back to work full-time, that‚Äôs when those freezer meals have been really clutch!

However, now that he can roll, this isn‚Äôt great anymore. He rolls into the side bars and gets all mad at it.

\*We'll I'm so happy for you! So many people give advice so I'll keep my mouth shut, people just don't understand that people are going to raise their children how they want to. It's also so unnecessary that women feel the need to share their terrifying labor stories...""I was in labor for 30 hours and pushed for 2 whole days!"" hahahahahaha who needs that am I right?!

Me: \*gurgles\*

\*Your lady bits are made of the same tissue in your mouth so when you're hormonal or bleeding down there, that's why you bleed up here in your mouth.

me: \*gurgles and coughs\*

\*I'm just gonna share ONE thing with you. I shook uncontrollably during transition...you know...when the baby actually moves into your vagina?

Me: ""Uhhuh...""

\*Well, I SHOOK.  SHOOK! And I had NO idea the baby was coming before then. We just decided to go in for a check and didn't bring my bag...even though I was 39 weeks I didn't knowwww! I was 6cm! I got there at 2, they broke my water, and was pushing the baby out by 5, ready to go home by 6! Super easy until that shaking started! No one told me about that. I asked for an epidural at that point cause I just wanted it to stop...and guess what?!

Me:""Whha?""

\*The only numbed me from the waist up! I couldn't move! Can you believe that!

Me: ""ah...?""

\*We'll that nurse fixed the whole thing. Brought the guy back in and took the epidural out! I really didn't need one, I didn't really feel any pain...I was just worried about shaking. I have a high pain tolerance though! Oh it was the best experience! I only had one though, I didn't want to be a ""screaming"" mom... Did you know that primary colors make your baby smarter? Well, what do I know, but I painted my nursery a light blue, and came home one day and my husband had completely painted the room in primary colors with purple and green trim! It looked awful! But he said someone at work told him that primary colors make the baby smart! We kept the room like that...and my son is an electrical engineer so I guess it worked! Who knows! What colors do you guys have?

Me: Well, like a light green-blue color, with mountains on the walls.

\*Well what do I know. They don't care what the room looks like! That sounds adorable! Your teeth look great! You know they say that during pregnancy you're the healthiest you'll ever be?! Cause of all those vitamins and all the blood flow! Unless you get a complication. What cravings have you been getting?

Me: Sweets and Strawberry Ice cream.

\*Oh you shouldn't eat those! When I was pregnant, I wanted junk too. I was working with a woman who was pregnant too! You know what she was craving?! SALAD with Italian dressing! Why couldn't I crave that! Instead I wanted oreos! Oreos!

Anyway...this lasted the whole 30 min cleaning. She talked my ear off! Glad I get 6 months in between visits! She even took it upon herself to check to see if I can get an extra visit with my insurance because I'm preggo. THANK GOD that I don't! See ya in June!

I didn't want to post in TTC after loss because I'm not quite ready to post an introduction and just would like some specific advice from those who have and haven't lost, as I'm sure plenty of new moms want to give back to the team that helped them give birth regardless of outcome. If you look in my post history, you'll see that I was pregnant this year with my first, a baby girl. You'll also see that I lost her on her birth day 8/10/18 in an emergency c-section. The doctors did everything the could for her, and they literally saved my life. They brought me from the brink of death, they cried with us when they lost her. The nurses who took care of me before and after were absolute angels, I could not ask for better care or bedside manner. My new doctor is my absolute savior during this whole process as well as the journey leading up to trying again. I have no clue how to ever repay her and want to do something separate for her. Ever since I knew I wanted to do something for them, but wasn't quite sure how as we were in the thick of recovery and grief.

573,"December 5, 2018 at 5 in the morning, I woke up with excruciating contractions. My first thought was ""yes! I'm going to meet my baby boy soon!"" I picked up my go bag and started my 5 mile drive to the hospital. Only the pain of contractions were so unbearable, it took me two hours to do a 10min drive because I had to keep pulling over. A few times I woke up with my face in the steering wheel. I got to the hospital, checked myself in, got hooked to the monitors and excitedly waited for the staff to tell me labor has started. Only, they couldn't find his heartbeat. They called in the ob with the ultrasound machine and there was no heart beating. They didn't say anything at all. But I already knew what it meant. Tears just started falling and they moved me to an L&amp;D room, I was 5cm dilated. We decided that the safest course of action was to go ahead with naturally waiting for labor instead of our planned csection. 4 more hours of contractions and I was fully dilated and effaced. His dad came in time for me to push. I don't even know how long I was pushing him for. But at 1:22PM, he came out perfect and beautiful as ever. They handed him to me, I kissed him before he got whisked away to get cleaned up. A part of me wanted to get up and start CPR. I'm a nurse for crying out loud! I've saved people's lives with CPR, why couldn't I do the same for my baby?!? But I also know that in the minuscule chance that his heart starts beating again, his brain would have been too oxygen deprived to have any life worth living. They handed him back to me and his dad. We just sat there crying, telling him how much we loved him and how sorry we are. I will always relive those moments. And the 48 hours I got to spend with him, just cuddling him and telling him how much I will always love him.

As my username would imply, I have always been a nervous worrier who kind of let negative thoughts control my days. Even to the extent of staying firmly on the fence about having children for over a decade. Now that my baby is a little over a week old, I wanted to let you know that things can (and probably will) be better than you ever imagined, and having a baby is literally the best part of my life. Just a couple things:

- I was soo worried about losing my body and self to pregnancy. I didn‚Äôt particularly like being pregnant, and I complained everyday to my husband about the experience. Now, I actually already miss being pregnant and I wish that I actually took the time to enjoy the little things and actually take ‚Äúbump pics‚Äù. Pregnancy can suck for sure, but don‚Äôt be surprised if you find yourself missing the kicks and your belly.

- I listened to so many horror stories about childbirth that I went in expecting the absolute worst. Please don‚Äôt let your mind do this to you!! My experience with labor and delivery was actually wonderful, which is crazy because I had been so fearful of it. I know it‚Äôs different for everyone, but I already look back on it as one of the best days of my life and I‚Äôm so proud of what I accomplished.

- I listened to friends and acquaintances tell me how difficult life with a newborn was going to be, and I became depressed at the thought of not showering, zero sleep, never eating a warm meal, etc. Again, just my experience, but I have showered every day, gotten dressed, prepared meals, and slept reasonably well (sharing shifts in the night with my hubby). I do have a very supportive spouse and so far a very good baby but it can be done! 

- Finally, I worried every day of my pregnancy that I would not love my baby. I felt no bond with her while pregnant and this concerned me deeply. For me, the second she was laid in my arms I had a deep connection with her. She has made each day brighter and I love her so much! Not everyone will feel this instant bond, but please don‚Äôt worry your pregnancy away convinced you won‚Äôt love your child.

Will my SO miss the birth bc I go into labor early on the ONE day he‚Äôs on a 24 hour business trip? We don‚Äôt know the gender and the thought of me seeing our baby and finding out one second before him breaks my heart in a way I can‚Äôt explain. 

I‚Äôm terrified of losing the life we have together right now. I‚Äôve posted about that before and got some great advice though so I won‚Äôt go into that TOO much here but it still feels like I‚Äôm going through a grieving process.....we live in a sweet little ‚Äúbubble‚Äù that‚Äôs very much all about us.

I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll NEVER sleep again. I know this is irrational. But I can‚Äôt shake it. 

I‚Äôm terrified of breastfeeding. Up until now I had a very lax attitude about it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best but if I have to formula feed, it‚Äôll be fine. No mommy guilt here!!!‚Äù Yah right. Now I REALLY want it to work. So badly. 

I‚Äôve had an easy pregnancy compared to a lot of other moms. I‚Äôve gained less than 15 lbs. morning sickness sucked but was minimal and went away by 13 weeks. Sure now at 32-33 weeks, everything from the waist down hurts. I‚Äôm tired a lot. But I am blessed in that I don‚Äôt have to work so, it‚Äôs all easy to manage when i get to kick my feet up all day if i want.

Apparently there are 3 locations we'll stay in L&amp;D: triage type of open room with curtains while they check to see if you are far enough along to land a labor room, then you move into a private labor room until you give birth, followed by your post-delivery stay room (48 hrs for vaginal, 96 hrs for c-section). They do the third room so you get a ""clean space"" to recover in after baby's birth. She said since you are moving rooms you really don't want to carry all your luggage from room to room, especially if you haven't been admitted yet. 

Most of the hospital bag stuff people say to pack is useful for post-delivery, like snacks, clean clothes, toiletries, etc. My question is, are any of you packing a smaller separate bag just for labor? If you've given birth before, what did you actually use during delivery that would make sense to pack separately?

After multiple traumatic office visits, genetic testing, and a visit to the MFM specialist, we did get our test results back that indicated it was NOT aneuploidy, cystic fibrosis, or an infection. One of the worst experiences of our life was waiting on these tests. 
One of the tests they performed was to screen mama for genes for CF, Fragile X, and Spinal Muscular atrophy. 
We were informed that mama is a carrier for 1 SMA1 gene and 3 copies of SMA2. As we have come to understand, this is an autosomal recessive disease that can be fatal by the age of 2 if the SMA1 genes are inherited, but can be less severe if SMA2 is. 
Unfortunately, the midwife who delivered our carrier screening results is advocating that I [30M] (dad) take the carrier screen as well.
I called the company of the test (Progenity) to talk to the genetic counselor and they told me, given no family history on either side and being white, there is a 1:140 chance the baby has SMA. 
Even with this being &lt;1%, we are confused and scared why the midwife team is suggesting we take the test. 
We never wanted carrier screening, but obviously with the EB, it opened that door. 

We are also looking for reassurance, and it seems no one will provide it. I would really appreciate some logic and advice for how to proceed with more testing or letting it be. 
Thanks",Genetic Testing worries,1

592,"So last night at 1 am I got up and suddenly felt a massive pressure down in my pelvis area. My daughter is breech and often kicks down but usually that is a more localized and sharper pain. I walked into the bathroom and suddenly about half a glass of liquid started to run uncontrollably out of my body (not sure whether from my vagina or from peeing). I had peed not too long before and not drunk much since. The liquid was clear and did not smell of urine, which my urine usually does. I called triage and they told me to come in. As I stepped into the elevator at the hospital another sudden though slightly shorter gush of liquid came out and made a mess on the floor.

I went into triage and they monitored my daughter (who was doing fine) and did a test to see if my waters had broken. The doctor said that from everything we had recounted to him that it sounded like my waters had broken, however, the test didn't change to positive.

They said it might have been something else but I am a very small person and I can't see that there would be room for that much other liquid, my daughter, my organs and the ambiotic fluid. The amount that flooded out, for me, is a lot but because they didn't have proof that my waters had broke they sent me home. As someone who has been through a stillbirth I want to know for sure if waters have broken or not as that makes a massive difference.

I am worried about infection now and my labour coming on quickly while I am away from hospital. I am 33 weeks + 4 days and I have already had two previous preterm labour scares (one which required medication to stop it.)

I asked for an ultrasound to check the ambiotic fluid levels but they said I might have to wait a week to get an appointment. Feeling so confused, angry and frustrated because they sent me home NOT because they they thought my waters hadn't broken but because the just couldn't prove it. The more time that passes the more I second guess myself and think that I am going crazy because I was so certain and yet they keep telling me no :(

UPDATE: So I managed to get a last minute ultrasound appointment. Spoke to my OB and support midwife and they were both as confused as my husband and I.

Tl;dr company renting time sensitive pregnancy product does not reliably ship on time. 

After my SVT episode, and getting classified high risk, I had decided to splurge on the bloom.life contraction tracker, because I started having contractions and I am a sucker for smart tech. 

If you aren‚Äôt familiar it‚Äôs a small adhesive device that syncs with an app to track contractions, and help differentiate between BH, and real contractions. It costs about $25 a week, but I really felt it would be worth it for some peace of mind. You have to order it about 2-3 weeks before you want it to show up, and you begin paying when you activate it on the app. 

Today I got an email saying that it would not ship for at least another week or two, when I was expecting it to show up any day! They apparently ran out because it‚Äôs a rental, and people weren‚Äôt returning them on time. This seems like a ridiculous oversight for a company that knows they are dealing with overwhelmed new parents. 

I had them cancel my order because by the time it comes I‚Äôll be 36 or 37 weeks, and if I go into labor then, I‚Äôll be csectioned so it doesn‚Äôt even matter. I wanted it for, and had ordered it according to their timeline, for the next couple weeks, but now I‚Äôm stuck writing down every contraction. 

Just wanted everyone to know that they aren‚Äôt a reliable company, and quite honestly, their customer service really sucked and basically told me ‚Äúwell they haven‚Äôt been returned so you‚Äôre shit out of luck!‚Äù ",Bloom.life disappointment.,1
594,"I'm in the hospital with pre-eclampsia. Plan is to be here until baby is delivered. Trying to find the right balance between letting baby cook longer and not risking my health any further. I'm having high BP's, sometimes very high, and had protein in my urine. The other labs are clean. 

They've said if I had pre-eclampsia with severe features, that 34 weeks is plenty and they'd deliver me immediately. It seems like I'm tiptoeing right up to that line over and over again, but not QUITE hitting their benchmarks for severe features. I'm terrified, more for myself than for baby at this point. I have a couple of questions for those who've maybe had pre-e before. 

After being admitted, I had a pretty bad headache that was getting worse. They gave me Tylenol. Headache carried over into the next day. Tylenol didn't relieve it, so they gave me migraine meds via IV. That finally kicked the headache. Every now and then I'll get a little bit of a headache but it mostly clears up. I haven't needed the Tylenol since. 

The other night, I experienced flashes in my vision, like lightning, in the middle of the night. This was after a rough night of climbing BPs (highest was 180/100, and they gave me IV meds to get it back under control). A few hours later, these lightning flashes happened as I opened my eyes, maybe 10 times, around 2 or 3 am. My BP was 120/69 at 2 am. My BP was 155/85 at 6 am. I don't know what it was as the visual thing was happening. Docs don't seem too concerned because it went away. 

Last night, I was woken up from a nap with sharp stabbing right upper quadrant pain. It lasted maybe 20-30 seconds, then eased up. Hasn't come back. BP was 140/90. 

This morning, my vision is blurry. At 2am my BP was 130/80 range. My BP on waking was 155/87. They gave me my oral meds (labetalol). BP came down to 125/80. Checked it twice since to make sure. Small amount of a headache that a Diet Coke relieved. Baby's in the process of passing an NST with flying colors as we speak. 

My question is, for those who've had pre-e, did your ""severe"" symptoms ilike headache, vision changes, and right upper quadrant pain have to coincide with a high BP AT THAT MOMENT to qualify? They keep dismissing all these things because my blood pressure isn't high right the minute that they're happening. Is that right? I can't seem to find an answer to this anywhere, and I want to trust my medical team but I can't shake this intuition that something's not right here.

596,"I feel like every time I come on here I'm whining about something but here it goes....

Currently I am 37+5 weeks pregnant with a biiiig baby. My doctor told me last week that it could be any time now... Which let's be real this is true for anyone when you get to this point of pregnancy. Today he told me that if I'm still pregnant next Monday that we are going to schedule an induction at 39 weeks. I am totally ok with the idea of an induction (especially if it means I can possibly avoid a C-section). However, of course I'd love to go into labor on my own. So I am doing what I can to naturally induce my own labor.

Aannnnywaay, there are 3 people who I would consider my ""support team"" through pregnancy and L&amp;D: My SO, my mom, and my best friend of 10+ years. My SO  has a 6 yr old who we have half of the time. There are one or two days a week where my SO is potentially unavailable from 7a-11p because he works in a secured mental facility and does not have access to his phone. My fear from the beginning was going into active labor when it was just me and my step daughter and not being able to manage labor and taking care of her at the same time. The plan to combat this as I got closer to labor was that when SO wasn't available either my mom or my best friend would come up to my house when they weren't at work (they live 30+ minutes away) and spend time with me just in case I needed them... That way if I did go into labor and had to wait for SO to get home, I wouldn't be alone with a  6 yr old... And then someone was there to watch her until her mom could get her. This has been the plan for MONTHS. Now that the time has come I asked my best friend to spend time with me on her day off this week as I have my Step daughter and my SO works all day, and we've known for a week that I can go into labor at any point. When I asked her she told me it was last minute (?) And that she has plans with her boyfriend... But that if I feel ""funky"" and I call she will head right over.... Which would be completely reasonable if her boyfriend didn't live an hour and a half away from my house.... not to mention I *always* feel ""funky"" and am consistently having Braxton Hicks/ contractions at this point and the baby is super low. I feel *extremely* disappointed in her right now as she gave me the impression that she would absolutely be here for me as I got close to labor. I have only asked her for one thing and now feel as though I inconvenienced her. I have yet to respond to her (this conversation is via text) because I'm worried that I'm being overly sensitive because I am grouchy and stressed... Generally I would say I am an easy-going, level-headed pregnant lady and have been pretty good at rolling with the punches. I feel like asking her to follow through on a plan we spoke about months ago isn't last minute. I was honestly surprised I even had to ask and that she was still planning to drive to her boyfriend's so close to my delivery when  she planned on being in the room with me when I gave birth, as he lives almost an hour away from her and even further from me. I get that she has her life and it doesn't revolve around my having a baby.... But why even bother  insisting on being here for me if your gonna bail on me last minute??? Now I'm left in an uncertain situation and just have to bank on my baby staying put. I asked my partner if I'm being a pregnant bitch for being so upset and he told me that it was pretty messed up of her...

The results of my amino came back positive for Down Syndrome. Since they saw it in her skin cells it is very unlikely that she has Mosaicism but the particulars can only be confirmed when my baby is  born but they are certain that she does have some form of Down Syndrome.

They also saw some more concerning things with her heart and we had an echo done at the pediatric cardiologist and they told us that she also has a heart defect that would need surgery between 4 and 6 months and could potentially have another one as well that would need heart surgery a couple days after birth.

Me and my boyfriend were very scared and worried when we heard the news and we had to take time to grieve and process things for a while. We were given both these diagnoses a day after another and it was a complete shock to our system. I was a wreck for awhile and truly so was he.

After a couple of weeks I got in contact with my local DSN and they are all incredible and supportive people. Meeting with the parents in the group and their children has really changed my perspective on Down Syndrome. I realized how many kids with Down Syndrome do so well and while they still have challenges it really isn't the end of the world. Before I thought of myself before as a very liberal and open-minded person but I had to sit and realized that I believed some ableist things that were not true. I'm grateful to keep proving these thoughts wrong and becoming a better and more socially aware person.

While I'm still terrified of the surgeries she'll need and of what the future may hold for her I'm trying to live day by day and use my fears to be the best advocate for my baby as I can. I'm asking all the questions and keeping in touch with the DSN and my providers to have the best plan in place for her treatment and enrichment.

Don't get me wrong, some days I still cry and get angry and scared but I feel a lot more hopeful that things will eventually be okay.

Disclaimer! My MIL and I have a wonderful relationship. If I put my foot down and say no she will respect my wishes. Please do not bash her, she's been more supportive to me as a ftm (22w+6d) than my own mother (who has only seen me once since I told her the news). I communicate openly and fairly easily with my MIL. I'm looking for ways to *constructively* tell her no, other than I'm just not comfortable with it.

The crib in question. It's a solid oak, drop side crib that's roughly 35 yrs old. They say they've cross referenced all the current safety standards and the only thing that doesn't conform is the drop side. It's very clean and has a new mattress.

My MIL has an extreme sentimental attachment to this crib. It's the same one she used for her first and last child (my husband) who they had a lot of difficulty conceiving. She's been trying to push this crib on me since before we got pregnant. I told her then that I'm not comfortable with it because to put a baby in a crib that old is a huge no no nowadays so we'd be taking a pass. I informed her that unfortunately the only thing to be done with it, other than storing it forever, is to throw it away. I expressed all my concerns about safety and gave her a flat ""thanks, but no thanks.""

Somehow this conversation prompted her to think that if they ""updated"" the crib I'd be ok with it. When they approached me about it they were framing it almost like a sales pitch. ""The only thing that doesn't conform is the drop side and you know me, I'd *never* leave it down."" My husband was in the room and I thought he'd have my back when I said no and his response was, ""If it meets all the safety standards I don't see what the problem is."" I told him, no offense, but he hadn't researched cribs the way I did for months before choosing one. Moreover it doesn't meet all the standards because it has a drop side. I'm not comfortable with it. It's too old. Husband, MIL, and FIL started going on about how they didn't understand why I'm not comfortable with it and that it's not a big deal, that MIL is too much of a hawk to ever leave the drop side down, until my FIL noticed my frustration and chimed in with the important reminder that, ""No matter what we're going to respect your decision. If you say no then the answer is no."" That's when I suggested we table the conversation so that I could speak privately with my husband about it and we'd get back to them.

So here we are, 3 weeks later. Still haven't brought it up to my husband because he doesn't see the problem. Which is the most frustrating thing of all. He's very much like his mother, when they think they're right, they're right and it's just a matter of convincing you why they're right. Whereas there are just some things that I've had to put my foot down on and, even after explaining why, they still believed I was wrong because they ""don't understand/don't see the problem."" It gets to the point where I have to say, ""I've explained myself, even though I didn't need to. The answer is no."" Then they *usually* back off and respect that.

I need help with constructive explanations as to why this is not ok. Other than I'm not comfortable with it. Due to MILs emotional attachment to this crib she's going to push back pretty hard. Luckily FIL is very reasonable and understands that me not being comfortable with it is all the reasoning they need not to put our baby in a death trap, lol. So he'll keep her in check.

Best case scenario I can convince them why this is a bad and dangerous idea and that they should let it, and the damn crib, go. Worse case scenario I play the ""bad guy"" after explaining why it's a bad idea and just say, ""that's it. I've made my decision, there's no convincing me otherwise. The answer is no."" Which I'm 100% prepared to do. 

The goal is to say no without hurting any feelings as my MIL is *very* emotionally attached to this crib.

622,"My coworker/friend has had lots of opinions and judgments since I told her about my pregnancy. She has 2 little ones and was always telling me she couldn‚Äôt wait for me to have kids so I was honestly surprised when she was so judgmental. I thought she‚Äôd be a real ally for me and kind of a mom mentor (she‚Äôs 10 years older). 

I‚Äôve since stopped sharing any baby related ideas or opinions with her because she‚Äôs already hurt my feelings a few times. We were talking casually and she told me she really likes Ariana Grande. I told her that I was going to see her in concert in May and she immediately shifts and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have a brand new baby!‚Äù in a tone that implied I shouldn‚Äôt be going.

I‚Äôve tried to take all her bullshit in stride but this I just beyond annoying to me. I can do basic math, I understand I‚Äôll have a little baby potentially a few weeks old at that time. Before buying tickets my mom already agreed (literally begged me actually haha) to come with me and get a hotel room so she can watch the baby while I go to the concert for 4 hours. My friends who I‚Äôm going with have other friends who would buy my ticket if I decide last minute it‚Äôs too much for us. I‚Äôm a grown adult and I think I can handle 4 hours away from my baby.

I just had to vent this out because I hate the implication that my life is over because I‚Äôm having a baby.

624,"So according to my doctors, I'm currently 21+2 weeks. I had my anatomy a week ago (baby boy!) and haven't heard anything else regarding a different due date, but how likely is it I'm further along that possible? I got pregnant directly off the Mirena. It came out June 29th, found out I was pregnant August 8th, and on September 7th they said I was 8 weeks.

However, I can REALLY feel baby move. Like a lot. Outside my tummy as well, and you can see my stomach distend. I've got a bit of a pudge so it's not that there isn't a layer there either. Almost everything I've come across says that flutters should have started at 16ish week at the earliest, but I started feeling things around 13 (and maybe 12, but I wasn't certain), and by 14 it was definitely baby I felt moving. 

That sounds super early to me. Like there's no way he was that big at 12-14 weeks that I could feel him so much?

625,"Hello, I have a nine week old son. 

When I was pregnant I took a breastfeeding class.

All of it was very interesting but the most important takeaway that the instructor gave us was to express and/or pump and/or breastfeed (your choice) as much as humanly possible in the first 72 hours after birth. 

Directly after birth you are still anatomically building your breastmilk infrastructure. If you want to try to ensure that you can make all the milk you want later, be sure to maximize on getting the milk out in the first three days. It's so crucial.

626,"I‚Äôm posting this as I‚Äôve recently seen a lot of posts asking about being induced and wanted to give my experience.    

Apologies for massive wall of text ahead and any formatting issues.   

TL:DR - was induced, felt pain, had epidural. Laboured for 16 hours and pushed for 7 minutes.

Uk based so might differ slightly.   
I went for a blood test on Mon 11th Sept 17 at 40W4D as my midwife was concerned about my blood pressure and protein level in my sample.   The results came back that I had markers for preeclampsia so they told me to go out and have a lovely evening as I would be checking into the induction bay the next day and not leaving until I had a baby.   
Well looks like we‚Äôre having our anniversary meal a day early then :)   

Returned to the hospital at 10am the next day, get settled in my bed and then they did the pessary first.  Yowsers!!! Didn‚Äôt help that my cervix was completely closed and still bruised from an attempted sweep just a few days ago.   
Left it in for a few hours but by about midnight I was in so much pain (not labouring or anything just uncomfortable, like a tampon in the wrong spot).  

The nurse on duty that night was wonderful, she ran me a bath so I could attempt to move or remove the pessary as needed and got me some painkillers. Odd experience of being naked in the bath and having a lovely lady come in with a cup of tea and 2 Co-Codamaol but I highly recommend it :) 

I ended up removing the pessary in the end as I could not get it to fit properly and was able to get some sleep. I highly recommend packing your own pillow for extra comfort. 

So 7am comes along and with it breakfast and obs, including the nurse asking if I‚Äôd like to try another sweep. Well I‚Äôd been a bit traumatised by my last one so was unsure but they offered me gas &amp; air to help.   
I don‚Äôt know if it was the gas &amp; air or if this doctor had smaller hands but this time it was much better! Still painful as I was very tender but I managed to say ‚ÄúSugar Honey Iced Tea‚Äù instead of actually screaming ‚ÄúSHIT!!‚Äù Which made the doctor, nurses and my fianc√© all laugh their socks off.   
So now I‚Äôm just waiting on a room in the birthing area, and from the sounds of it I was convinced it would be another night of waiting. We even called his family and said come for some tea at 6 as I was bored.  (Warrington General has a Costa &amp; a Subway! Life is good)    
I knew I needed more obs at some point so went over to the nurse at 5:30 and asked if we could do it now.... nope a space is available and your going to have your baby. What???   

So quick call to his dad to cancel tea and then get the things together and move over. Next thing I know, I‚Äôm in one of the ‚Äúhigh risk rooms‚Äù (not as scary as it sounds, it just has extra equipment for monitoring me &amp; the baby and means I can get an epidural if needed). Just waiting for the doctor to come in and discuss options.   
At this point my emotions get to me and I have a bit of a breakdown. It was suddenly real, I‚Äôm about to give birth.   
What if I can‚Äôt do it? What if it hurts too much? Can I even be a mum? (Spoiler alert: I did do it, it hurt like buggery but painkillers are great and I currently have a wonderful healthy 15mo).  
Doctor comes in and we decide to break my waters first to see if that could get me started. I was really hoping it would as I knew if I had to have the drop then I would need to stay on the bed. 
Well they broke them at 7 and I pottered around the room (leaving a delightful mess btw) but at 8pm the doctor returned to say that I‚Äôd need the drip as no progress had been made. 

Bugger!   
Ok I can do this!   
On to the bed I go, canula in and induction begins. 
8:00pm Level 1 - ok I can manage this, contractions are there now (so that‚Äôs what they feel like! Not just a twinge but almost like a moment of pain that seemed to freeze time) no gas &amp; air at this point, just breathing through. 
8:30pm Level 2 - wow that‚Äôs a bit more intense.... ok zone out, focus on that spot on the wall that desperately needs painting and breath through it.   
9:00pm Level 3 - hmmm gas &amp; air now please!! Yes I‚Äôm breathing!! No, I‚Äôm not happy
9:30pm Level 4 - fucking shut that music off, no I don‚Äôt want to sit up any more! Hi Mum! You brought food for Daz? Good. Now fuck off out of here Daz and don‚Äôt come back till it‚Äôs finished or I will cut you!
Pain relief? Oh god yes please! NOW!!

So at this point the drip is now compelling my labour to move faster and this is where the horror stories come in of how it‚Äôs more painful, only because your body is trying to move at the same pace but struggling to control the pain. At least this was my experience. It was now that I also had some issues with the nausea that a lot of women experience with being induced so after every contraction I‚Äôd use the gas &amp; air and then be sick. Giving birth is amazing but it‚Äôs not always glamorous. I was then offered either dismorphine or an epidural.   
Hell yeah, epidural please!

10pm Level 5 - Breathe, grunt, vomit. Breathe, grunt, vomit. 

10:30pm Level 6 - And in walks a wonderful angel in scrubs to help take the pain away. I love you..... wait. You want me to sit up and bend over? BITCH!!!! 
Epidural attempt 1 - Ok hold as still as you can, oh that‚Äôs a contraction isn‚Äôt it.   
Epidural attempt 2 - Let‚Äôs try again but please don‚Äôt move... oh another contraction.    
Epidural attempt 3 - Please Miss P, we really need you to try and hold still. You can do this. Ah, swing &amp; a miss!  

By this point my midwife was concerned that I was in a bit too much distress to mange this but me and the anisetist decided we‚Äôd give it one more go.  

Epidural attempt 4 - OK, we can do this. Hold still. Needle is in, drugs being administered. Ahhhh relief!!! Once again she was an angel in scrubs and no longer a bitch.    

11:30pm Level  8 - So shall we put the tv on? Nap? I don‚Äôt need to nap I feel great! 

12:00 Level 10 - I‚Äôm happy &amp; chatting away so we decide to jump it up a bit more. Can feel some pressure but otherwise manageable.  

3:00am Level ??? - This is where things start to get hazy and I lost track of time. The drip had been upped to about 16 by this point, I was back using the gas &amp; air and also feeling sick again. The sensation itself was just a huge amount of pressure and urge to push more than pain, but not comfortable. The next few hours were a blur until.... 

8:00am Level Um a LOT?? - In walks Fran who will be delivering my baby. She was also the midwife who did my antenatal acupuncture so mid contraction/grunt I say ‚ÄúHi Fran‚Äù in a very chipper voice. Then back to grunting at the surprise and amusement of all in the room. 

So again it was all very much a blur from this point, checks had been made but they didn‚Äôt really tell us any details. Just that progress was being made but slowly or quickly. But at 10:30 Fran let me know we were getting close to pushing. 

10:41 - OK chloe its time to push now. Hmm baby‚Äôs head is facing up, no wonder you were uncomfortable.  

10:44 - Hmmm seems that baby doesn‚Äôt want to come out so we may have to give you a little help, I‚Äôll page the doctor to come in an look at doing an episiotomy 

10:46 - I can see the head!!!

10:48 - Congratulations! Daddy would you like to hold your baby? 

At which point Daz was able to tell me we had a beautiful baby girl, with a shocking amount of gorgeous hair and I got to cuddle her whilst he cut the umbilical cord.  
She was whisked away for checks and to make sure she was ok from her rather fast entrance to the world but soon back on my chest snuggled into me. And I also then got to have the most amazing slice of toast I‚Äôd ever eaten. In fact, I had 4 rounds of toast! With an incredible cup of tea :) 

I had a 2nd degree tear that required some stitches (didn‚Äôt ask how many) and had to be temporarily catheterised due to the epidural. I was then on the ward by about 1pm. 

I have a diary of my first couple days with Jess which I‚Äôll happily type up if anyone is interested

It‚Äôs been about 7 months and i felt like I‚Äôd update on this situation. I originally posted a bit of a rant about coming down with Bell‚Äôs palsy and how unfortunate the timing was and all that Jazz. 


Things i learned: nobody knows enough about this and it touches so many more people than we realize. I was really frustrated in the beginning because there seemed to be a lack of information on care steps and thank goodness for my amazing OB because the only information i got came from him. 


You have to take care of your eye, good gel drops and an eye patch to sleep protect from your eye getting damaged.

Your tongue will start to heal first! 


It‚Äôs normal to have changes in your hearing on the effected side, this is something nobody could really answer for me until i saw a neurologist. 


A couple weeks ago i saw a neurologist and he told me that 85% of people make a full recovery. Unfortunately he advised that i was part of the 15%. I have permanent damage and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm slowly coming to terms with. 


In no way can most people tell, unless I‚Äôm really tired or stressed out i will start to droop a bit. But i see it all the time, my comfort is in the fact that my beautiful little boy got my smile so i still get to see it. 




In general, i think that nobody talks about the potential mental health affects this can have on you. I had some dark days in the beginning and around the 4 month mark when i started to realize i wasn‚Äôt healing anymore. Talk to someone about it if you‚Äôre struggling, it‚Äôs not abnormal to struggle with this and nobody should feel alone.

633,"So this has been an ongoing issue between DH and I from the start of our discussions re his parents visits/involvement after LO arrives and I‚Äôm feeling really low and just not heard. I think DH is feeling the same way because he told me he‚Äôs been having to advocate for his parents getting meaningful time with the baby, but I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm bending over backwards to ensure they get their time. I‚Äôm so fed up with worrying and arguing over visitors, and just need perspective, support and advice. Part of my thinking is I just want the people I‚Äôm closest to around me while I‚Äôm recovering from surgery, but I get the feeling (and maybe unfairly) my DH wants to ensure equal access to baby by both of our families... but I think that‚Äôs impossible and an imposition on me. For background:

&amp;nbsp;

DH is an only child and his parents are a three hour drive. I get along with MIL but I find FIL to be too much and don‚Äôt like him in my personal space. I don‚Äôt think he likes me that much either. His parents are a bit on the high maintenance side, but I know his mom will be helpful with cleaning and cooking.his dad will not be helpful and will go stir crazy after 1 day.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents and sisters are 2000 Kms away. I‚Äôm close with my family and they are super easy going and helpful. Mother is coming to stay with us, which has always been the plan. She had not yet booked her return flight waiting to see how much I needed her. My dad won‚Äôt be able to visit for a while as he‚Äôs getting surgery shortly after LO‚Äôs due date. My older sister is flying in 2 weeks after due date for a week and younger sister + 5 month nephew will visit for a week when it makes sense re timing.

&amp;nbsp;

Initially my plan was to have a natural birth with no intervention at a birthing center with midwives. I‚Äôve planned only for this outcome, never giving a thought to having an epidural or a C-sectio. With that in mind DH and I did finally come to an agreement around visitors, but DH was a bit upset and so was MIL.  I said ILs could come after 48 hours for a visit for one night. We live in a small house that can‚Äôt accomodate too many people- also I get overwhelmed with people I‚Äôm not comfortable with in my space... add the recovery from childbirth plus breastfeeding plus exhaustion and I feel like I would easily get overwhelmed. DH finally conceded but I reassured him that ILs will be invited back for a couple of nights and we would try to visit ILs a couple of weeks after with my mom and LO. 

&amp;nbsp;

However my beautiful birth plans got thrown out the window when we learned baby is breeched, and a couple of days later - after a failed ECV - there I was discussing a planned C-section with my midwife, which really threw me. I was really disappointed with this outcome as it never crossed my mind I would have one...it‚Äôs still bittersweet but I‚Äôm trying to process the C-section/recovery as well as grieving the birth I wish I could have. I‚Äôve begun to tell more and more people re C-section and trying to get excited that LO could be here next week. Also my mom changed her flight and is arriving sooner in anticipation of the C-section date, which we don‚Äôt know yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now that timelines have moved up by approximately two weeks and LO could be here for Christmas, we are left figuring timing yet again for his parents. My older sister hasn‚Äôt changed her flights but now considering my younger sisters timing so my mom can be home for my dads surgery in early January. Yesterday (earlier in the day) I said to DH that maybe his parents could drop in for a visit for 15 minutes to 30 minutes on day 2 at hospital (they‚Äôve driven 6 hours round trip to spend 3 hours with us in the past)- he pushed and said they should stay the night and leave the next morning after 2nd visit with baby... I don‚Äôt agree yet because I‚Äôm just tired and overwhelmed. Anyway, then I said they could come for for a night or two for Christmas, and we‚Äôd look at visiting around New Years or a bit later depending on my recovery... but DH said 3 nights around Christmas would be better. At that point I said let‚Äôs just wait to find out surgery date, but I did not like how much he was thrusting his parents on me after I was involving them...even though I know it will be difficult on me as I‚Äôd prefer not to have them visit for 2 weeks. We then spent a great day together as this could be our last weekend ahead of LO‚Äôs arrival.

&amp;nbsp;

Last night the topic comes up again, because I then introduce that my mom will go home in the new year and we could look at having his mom come up for a couple of nights and the my younger sister will fly in, and overlap with my older sister‚Äôs visit by a couple of days. Basically it works so every week for 3 or 4 weeks his parents are seeing the baby, but apparently DH doesn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough... it‚Äôs almost as if he wants his parents around as much as my mom and two sisters combined, if that makes sense. I want my mom and sisters around to help with recovery... but I don‚Äôt know if DH understands that and I feel like he just thinks I don‚Äôt want his parents around to punish them or something?! I also told him that I would find it difficult to have his dad around for an entire week, which DH proposed. DH says that before my younger sister arrives his parents should be given more time with the baby, as we should prioritize visits by parents first and then by siblings - ugh! But DH doesn‚Äôt have siblings and isn‚Äôt the one going through surgery... but DH states that ‚ÄúWE are having the baby‚Äù. I told him that while we are going to be parents, this is all happening to me. I also told hi. His parents are a 3 hour drive, while for my immediate family it requires more time, effort and money for them to visit - but he doesn‚Äôt see how unfair that is.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I‚Äôm being really fair and accommodating... and for whatever reason this is not enough for DH? I feel like he‚Äôs prioritizing his parents needs over my comfort and needs and I‚Äôm feeling sad and defeated. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I don‚Äôt want anyone around for 2 weeks in order to avoid all of this arguing and hurt feelings. I don‚Äôt want to worry about anyone else‚Äôs feelings except my own, and maybe that‚Äôs selfish but I think I‚Äôve earned a bit of selfishness.

*****

Before I start:

- I'm using a throwaway because we've been waiting to announce until 12w and friends know my usual handle. 
- Also I have contacted my doctor and am set with my ob-gyn to come in Monday, so seeking medical advice and support already.

I've searched lots of /r/babybumps threads and seen similar stories that go various ways; I really am just a nervous first-time mom-to-be and could use support since we aren't telling friends or family anything until we know more so I'm very much alone in this (with the exception of my incredible husband who is listening to my woes and caring for me, love this man).

Long story short, found out we were pregnant at ~4 weeks, had possible implantation spotting around ~5 weeks, but turned out fine and it's been a good several weeks as we had 2 ultrasounds done - one when I was spotting to confirm it wasn't ectopic, and one a couple weeks back to see growth and hear our baby's heartbeat for the first time. All has been well.

I was diagnosed with a UTI at the same time as our first confirmation appointment, and as of yesterday had seen my physician for another suspicious slightly discolored discharge and vaginal itching - diagnosed with another possible UTI, started antibiotics.

Everything seemed okay until last night. I went to the bathroom and, with nothing showing on my Pantiliners, I suddenly see fresh blood drops appear. I start to cramp within the hour as well, and called our ob-gyn on-call line - I'm told unless it gets severe, we can just wait.

Last night, woke up several times to feel more cramping and I'm continue to see fresh, raw blood; even had bloody discharge. It's not filling up any pads; in fact, it's not doing anything in the pads *until* I go to the bathroom no matter how I sit or move - nothing much other than small spotting on the pad until I go to the restroom, then it's more blood.

A second call to the ob-gyn (bless their patience) confirmed I can still wait.

I'm scared. I'm stuck at the mercy of my body and this sweet baby, wondering what the hell is happening and if instead of a pregnancy announcement, we may be sharing scary or sad news. I'm so frustrated with my body, and I hate not being able to share this with anyone since we (for reasons like this) felt strongly about waiting until first trimester end to announce. 

I get to pretend to the rest of the world I'm fine when I'm so nervous and scared our dream of our own baby may not be turning out okay (or could be fine, but time will tell).

Any ladies willing to share their stories or advice?

650,"To start off, this is my first pregnancy so I'm a little wet behind the ears. I'm 17 weeks pregnant with our girl, and my husband and I are very excited/nervous/all the emotions. 

I figured it would be about time to start talking about maternity leave with my employer, as I wanted to give them plenty of time to plan for my absence and get FMLA paperwork started. Generally, it's a great full-time job where I work from home, and the company prides itself on being very ""family-oriented"".

Well. After speaking to the employee who is pseudo-HR, I found out that they provide 5 days of paid maternity leave, and we are ""more than welcome"" to use our PTO to cover additional days. When I further inquired about FMLA, or whether any of that time would be covered (as I read most employers provide 60% pay as best practice), they said it would not. 

So, um, what the fuck do I do? Is this normal? I obviously thought it would be at least partially covered, and was planning/hoping to take more like 10 weeks off. Unfortunately, as this pregnancy was not planned, we don't have finances prepared like I would've hoped, so this issue is screwing everything up. Really freaked out/upset at the prospect of having to ship a 6 week old off to a daycare. I'm nervous about using up all my PTO, because what if we need it if I or the baby gets sick? 

Has anyone dealt with this, or have advice as to how to handle? My family/husband means well, but all I'm getting from them is ""it will work itself out,"" which is just not practical!

656,"FTM, due in March. Probably worrying too much and probably giving too much detail...

My husband and I have decided that the smallest room in our 3 bedroom rental is going to be set up as the nursery, and we've even rearranged everything to empty the room out so we can fill it with baby things. However, this room isn't very well insulated - it has two exterior walls, the third wall is against an uninsulated attic space, and it is over the garage. We live in the Midwest, so it can get quite cold in there in the winter and warm in the summer. Not to the point where it's a problem for adults, but when we used that room as a guest room I always made sure to have a fan in the summer and extra blankets in the winter. We've tried weather stripping and insulating the door into the attic space, but that doesn't seem to have helped much. I'm hesitant to do more because it is a rental. The landlord isn't going to do anything.

Typically the room is fine if we leave the door to the hallway open, but I definitely want the option to close the door as we have two dogs that might wander in otherwise, and so noise from around the house doesn't wake baby up.

All this being said, we are hoping to move out in July of this year, but things are a little uncertain at the moment and this depends on my husband being able to find a job by then. If he can't, we will probably be here until July 2020.

Basically, I'm second guessing the decision to use that room as the nursery. I'm worried baby will get too hot/cold. But if we move this July, in all likelihood, baby won't be sleeping in there too much as we plan to have them in our room for a while. I'd still like to be able to use the nursery for naps though.

The other bedroom is set up currently as a guest room/office/craft room, and it is quite a bit bigger so I'm not sure we could fit everything in the small room if we just wanted to swap.

660,"I'm 28 weeks today, and I spent almost the entire day and evening sitting in a hospital an hour away from home yesterday, in excruciating pain. I'm so stressed out about it. I'm afraid to eat or drink or even move around too much. It has been a really bad weekend. 

It started yesterday at about 2pm. I went to my parents house to celebrate a late Thanksgiving. I've been having stomach issues, but I took some imodium and decided to tough it out. I get there and eat and am just hanging out, when I start feeling these really tight cramps in my stomach. It was up high in the center. It felt like someone was grabbing my insides and squeezing as hard as they possibly could. They keep happening and getting stronger and more frequent. I tried to drink water because my step mom said it was probably contractions from dehydration. I called my OB and they told me to try and get to my hospital and if not, go to the nearest one. So, I decide I'm gonna try and make the almost hour drive with my 5 year old in tow, to my regular hospital. And then as I'm getting my shoes on, the ""contractions"" get unbearable. I literally had to just go down to the floor and ride it out because I couldn't even think or speak it hurt so bad. My step mom says she's taking me in to the hospital there and we will just have my records sent. I go to get in the car and start throwing up uncontrollably. At this point, we're still thinking this is baby related and that I'm possibly in preterm labor. 

Well, after several hours and an ultrasound and blood work, it is determined that the baby is fine(thank God) &amp; that my issues aren't OB related at all. They did, however, see gallstones when they did the ultrasound. The bloodwork showed that I didn't seem to have any infections or anything and that everything was working properly or whatever, but that my pain was likely caused by the gallstones. They didn't want to do surgery because of the baby, so they basically told me to wait it out and that even though by then, the ""attack"" was over, it would probably happen again before she's born. They said I could take tylenol for pain. 

Tylenol isnt going to cut it when I'm having one of these episodes. It's seriously difficult to find words to describe how painful this was. It was the worst pain I've ever felt. The only thing that prevented me from losing my mind was that it wasn't constant.

In a hurricane kit, you‚Äôre supposed to be prepared to shelter in place for 72 hours without any utilities such as power and water. I like to be prepared for a week without power. You also have to be prepared to evacuate to a shelter.

669,"My last 3 pregnancy appointments (the middle one of which was an extra emergency appointment) I had borderline high blood pressure, including 148/86, 140/92, and 126/94. The cutoff for high blood pressure is 140/90 (either number meeting or exceeding that number) so I was diagnosed with pregnancy induced hypertension and my doctor recommended inducing labor so that I would not go past my due date, and starting with my second to last appointments he had me bring my hospital bag to each appointment just in case. My due date wasn't exactly clear- according to my last period it was 11/30, according to the ovulation sticks it was 12/5 and according to the dating ultrasound it was 12/7, so we decided to induce on 12/3 so I would be at least 39 weeks (39+ 5 or 39+3). 

On Monday I got the hospital at 7:15am after walking my other daughter to the bus stop for her 7am bus. First they took a bunch of blood and hooked me up to an IV. It took them 5 different tries to hook me up to the IV- the nurse ""blew out"" veins in both of my hands, second nurse couldn't get a vein in my hand, and third nurse finally got it set up in my elbow, which turned out to be a pain in the ass cause whenever I bent my arm alarms started going off saying the IV was blocked. First they added an IV for a while and at around 8:30am they started me on pitocin, at level 2. Every half an hour or so after that they raised it by another 2. By 10am I was definitely feeling contractions but they weren't super painful. They paused for an hour at level 8, and then went up to level 10 which was the final level they needed. 

The plan was that the doctor would come back and break my water around 12:30ish if it hadn't broken on its own, but it broke around 11:30. By then I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes and with each one more water came out for a while. The contractions got a lot more painful after that so I ordered an epidural. I got up to pee for the last time and then went back to bed. The epidural guy got there around noonish and that's when things started going horribly wrong. Before they did the anesthesiologist asked if the music I was listening to was fleet foxes (it was) and mentioned that they listened to the same album when his wife gave birth. 

To do an epidural I had to sit on the edge of the bed and curve my back and lean forward. My husband sat in front of me and we waited for a contraction to end. The anesthesiologist first shot me with a 'bee sting' as he called it (numbing shot) and I felt that. I felt him start to put the epidural in but it didn't hurt, but I started feeling really bad. I said ""I feel dizzy"" and then everybody's voice started getting like muffled, and the next thing I knew people were lifting my legs and lying me down on my side, because I had fainted. (My husband later told me that after I said ""I feel dizzy"" I started learning forward and fainting and he told the nurse and they all caught me and put me on my side). The epidural guy finished up the epidural while I was lying on my side and the nurse put a wet towel on my head. 

I still had a towel in between my legs and I felt more fluid gushing out, only this time it was apparently blood. The nurses started getting worried and saying things like ""this is too much blood to be bloody show, I think something happened and that's why she fainted."" and they called my doctor. Every time I had a contraction more blood came gushing out and I kept saying things like ""I think I'm bleeding more"" every time it did. At that point my blood pressure started tanking, and the nurses started giving me blood pressure medication. They gave me at least 4 or 5 doses and kept reading my blood pressure and it was super low...one number I remember is 70/39. According to my husband during the last dose it shot up super high and they had to give me more medication to bring it down again. I was super out of it and lying down with a wet towel on my head and kinda sweating a lot while this all happened. 

I later found out that I had had a placental abruption, meaning my placenta had started to come loose too early (Normally doesn't come loose until after you give birth), which is really bad because the baby can stop getting oxygen. They aren't exactly sure what caused it, but it could have been it already happened in advance, or maybe when my water broke and there wasn't pressure in the womb anymore it caused the placenta to tear loose. It is also associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. Either way we were really lucky we were in the hospital when it happened, cause if I wasn't the baby could have died. 

At some point during this my doctor showed up and put a monitor onto the baby through my cervix to measure the baby's vitals. He started saying I should be prepared to have a c section if the baby's vitals started dropping too. The nurses gave me some thing to stick up my nose to swab it and then shaved my pubes. At that point the doctor said the baby's vitals were looking bad and we had to go do a c section right away. They gave me a paper to sign and then we were out of the room instantly and rushing to the OR. 

At the OR they had my husband wait outside while they got things ready. They moved me from the bed to an operating table and put some big paper blanket over me that had a cut out square in the middle, and probably did some other stuff I don't remember. My arms were out at my sides like I was on a cross or something. I could still feel my legs and I think they turned up the epidural. This whole time they were taking my blood pressure every minute or so, and they put what I thought were more blood pressure cuffs on my legs but what turned out to be some sort of circulation cuff things that made sure I didn't get blood clots in my legs. Someone rolled a spikey thing up my belly a few times and asked me to tell them when I could feel the spikes (it wasn't until the top of my belly). Someone else washed down my belly/hips/vagina with something yellow. They put up a sheet in front of my face so I couldn't see what was happening and at that point called my husband in, who sat near my face and held my hand. 

I could feel them cutting me open and a lot of tugging but it didn't hurt just felt like they were pulling on my intestines or something. Winter Rose was taken out at 1:39, and I asked my husband what time it was. She weighed 8 pounds 12.7 ounces which was more than a pound and a half more than my older daughter when she was born. They took her somewhere else in the room beyond my eye sight and started working on her and a minute or so later I heard her start to cry. They told me they had to take her to the NICU because she had aspirated a lot of blood, and that they were also removing a bunch of blood clots from my uterus. My husband went over to see her while they were still sewing me up and he said he saw my intestines and stuff (and that they weren't like when he took gross anatomy in college). He decided to go with her to the NICU after asking if it was ok with me. They took her over to my head so I could see her for a second before they took her away but I was pretty out of it at that point. My husband left and they were sewing me up for almost an hour it seems...I don't think I left the OR until around 2:30. 

Then I went to recovery where at first they put a heated gown on me and later a heated blanket that blew up like a raft. I was so cold that at first they couldn't get any temperature at all, and then they got a temp of 94. I stayed in recovery almost 2 hours. At some point they took out my epidural and gave me two doses of fentanyl. There was another couple in there behind a curtain who had a baby with them. My husband showed up around an hour later and said he had only been at the NICU for a few minutes and then was waiting in a waiting room and had no idea where I was for a while. They finally got my temp up to around 97.something and decided I could go to the NICU to see Winter for a few minutes. They called to see if they could come to the NICU in my bed since they couldn't put me in a wheelchair. 

We went to the NICU and hung out with Winter for about 10 minutes. She had a breathing mask on but they changed it to a nose oxygen tube so I could hold her, and also had a feeding tube and an IV and a bunch of wires hooked up to her to take her vitals. After that they wheeled me to my room on the special 3rd floor ""high risk OB"" floor. 

A bunch of nurses came to talk to me and a lactation consultant said to pump every 3 hours because Winter couldn't eat real food that night and was on an IV instead. The compression leg things were still on most of the night. At around 3am a nurse woke me up to take walk around the floor and pump and at 5:30am they woke me up to walk around again and finally took out the catheter I got the day before. When my husband got there around 7:30 he took me in a wheelchair down to the NICU to visit Winter. There were 3 other babies in the room and on our last day a 4th came in too. Most of the other babies were premies who were really tiny. 

We figured out the feeding schedule and I started coming back every 3 hours to try to breastfeed before they gave her formula, since my breast milk hadn't come in yet, in part cause I lost so much blood. The first two times she pulled out her feeding tube and the third time she did that they put the tube down her nose instead of down her throat. The first day we learned she needed antibiotics for at least 2 days to make sure she didn't get an infection from all the blood she inhaled. I also learned that day that I might need a blood transfusion since my hemoglobin was so low, but in the end they put me on iron pills and I didn't get one. Tuesday I was also super itchy all day and took a shower that night which didn't really help...the nurse said it was probably one of the meds I got the day before. The next day (Wednesday) when we got to the NICU they said she had pulled her oxygen tube out for at least half an hour so they were going to take it out and see how she did. That day she also got her last round of antibiotics. 

On Thursday she had pulled out her IV and they decided not to put it back in, but she still had a feeding tube, although they switched to try to feed her from a bottle instead of a feeding tube, which was the last thing she needed to do to get out. I also got some free lunch from some organization for NICU parents. Then on Thursday afternoon a NICU nurse showed up in my room and said she was feeding well from a bottle and they were going to room her with me that night. They too out the feeding tube and took off all the other monitoring wires and she stayed in my room wire-free. My older daughter overstayed the visiting hours and finally got to meet her, since children aren't allowed in the NICU. 

Thursday night it was me on my own with Winter. She woke up every 1-3 hours to eat, and since my milk still hadn't come in I would try to breastfeed for a while and then give her a bottle of formula when she would really freak out. By Friday morning my milk actually came in, and we met with a lactation consultant since she still didn't really want to latch because she got used to getting bottles super easily, but the lactation consultant did some syringe feeding thing from some breastmilk I had pumped and she started latching on better.

Instead, it seems I will be here until I leave with a baby. I have a history of hypertension, so preeclampsia has always been a risk. Test results look pretty good so far, but the doctors have seen enough to know they want to keep us closely monitored until further notice.

TLDR 40+9, 17 hours of contractions at home, 17 hours of contractions at hospital, epidural, assisted forceps delivery and episiotomy, healthy baby boy, trouble breastfeeding, mastitis, husband hospitalized, highly emotional, feelings of regret and isolation but we are going to be ok.

 I chose to go shared care with my GP and the midwives at the hospital (in australia). Due date was 10 November.  Came and went. I was considered low risk so my next check up was booked for 19th November.

I had no braxton hicks, no bloody show, did not lose my mucous plug and the baby did not drop so I thought he'd be in there forever. Everyone told me 'you'll definitely get braxton hicks' nope. Did not happen. 

At 12am on sunday 18th I started to have mild contractions. By 3am they were painful but bearable. I started tracking them. At 5am they were 50secs long and 2.5 minutes apart.  I rang the birth suite and they told me they weren't close enough together to come in but seeing as it was my first pregnancy they could assess me if I wanted to come in but would send me home if I wasn't 5cm dilated.

I sucked it up until 8pm that night.  All day I had contractions, with the biggest gap being 10 minutes apart around lunch time.  Had hot baths and panadol to try and ease the pain.  By 8pm they were getting too painful and I was in tears and rang the hospital again, even if it was just to get stronger pain relief and be sent home. 

Arrive at birthing suite and I start vomiting from the contractions. I am checked by the midwife and am 4cm dilated. She shows me some of my bloody show. They decide to admit me. They offer me pain relief and I ask for the epidural straight up. Thankfully I did it straight away as it took 4 hours for the anaesthetist to come as he was in surgery. I tried the gas while I was waiting but pretty sure it didn't work and was more of a placebo. 

Took 3 attempts to get the epidural in my spine. Fun trying to stay still while a needle is being jabbed in your back. Epi took longer to work on my left side so for an hour or so after I got it I was feeling the contractions on one side only. 

Was contracting 4 in 10 minutes prior to the epi. Slowed down once I got it and had to get the hormone drip. 

At 1am my waters were broken and I was 6cm. There was meconium in them. Midwife wasnt concerned and was happy to let me progress on my own.
5am I was 8cm
9am I was 9cm
10am I was still 9cm
11am I was fully dilated and ready to go.

The epi made it hard to push. I couldn't tell the difference between the 'good' pushes and the not good pushes. Felt like I was pushing the same way. I had a splitting headache that didn't help and each push made it hurt more. My throat was dry but I kept throwing up the water. I had some movement in my legs so tried pushing on my knees but it didn't help.  After an hour bubs was getting tired and distressed,I was getting tired and distressed and they called the doc in. Due to the meconium and I'm guessing other stuff I was unaware of  my room suddenly filled with people and I had a resuscitation team and neonatal team.

Doc decided assisted forceps would be best bet. With that came an episiotomy as he didn't want me to tear.  I was cut after I pushed bubs head out to make it easier for the shoulders.  Doc had to pull 5 times with the forceps.  As soon as bub was out and cried the room cleared out and it was just the 1 doc and my midwives. 

They put bub on me. Not going to lie, he was gunky and bloody and I made an ewww face. Did some skin to skin. Wasnt really sure how I was meant to feel. There was no crying on my part. Kinda like ' ok. I've got a baby now....fuck'.  7 pounds 6 ounces (3460g) and 51cm long. 

Stayed in hospital for 24 hours so they could monitor us.  Could not get bub to latch so I hand expressed and used a syringe. He has a high palette which makes latching more difficult apparently. 

Still couldn't get bub to latch at home so was hand expressing and syringe feeding him.  At least I knew how much he was getting.  On day 3 he latched for the first time and then on day 4 he latched again 3 times. Milk came in on day 4/5. Started leaking excessively and bub decided he wasn't going to latch anymore. Nipples were already raw from the few times he latched.

I had cried a gazillion times by then. Its funny because I was never 'I have to breastfeed breast is best' and was more 'fed baby is best' but when I was unable to get it to latch I just felt like the biggest failure. I felt like giving formula was failing. 

 Midwives visited me again on day 5 and showed me a new way to latch but every feed is still a fight with bub.

Got mastitis on Day 6. Doctor and antibiotics on day 7.  Bub wouldn't settle and I couldn't deal so gave him some formula.  Visited the lactation consultant on day 8 in tears as I thought I wasnt feeding bub enough and because he still would not latch.  Was told my supply was good, came home from that appointment to find my husband rolling around on thr floor in pain and called an ambulance. Hub was admitted to hospital on day 8 for 3 days.

Saw lactation consultant Again on day 9. Bub still wouldn't latch properly. Again I was in tears. Everything was overwhelming. I was leaking everywhere but bub wouldnt eat.  He would take expressed stuff though I also freaked out as he hadnt pooed for 2 days and thought it was because I gave him formula.

If you're still reading this kudos to you but I quickly finish up as I am tired of typing
- trying nipple shields to help with bub latching. 
- He probably has a bit of nipple confusion with the bottles vs my boob but I wanted to make sure bub is fed and not starving.
-health nurse said it also appears to be a bit lazy and knows it's easier to suck from the bottle. He will occasionally just sit with his mouth over my nipple letting my milk flow in during let down and wont do any work.
It takes about half an hour to get him latched. And that is half an hour if screaming, pushing me away,  trying to latch and getting frustrated when he cant, calming him down and repeating.
- had some super down days when hub was in hospital. Regretted having a baby, and realizing how much life was not the same.  Also felt isolated at home.  Was thinking I might have ppd and not just the baby blues.  
- have intermittent bouts of sadness but this week has been a lot better as I have gotten ot if the house with bub. 
- just have to keep reminding myself that as long as bub is getting fed that is the important thing and if I  have to Express and then bottle feed him that then so be it.  
- still hard to not feel like a failure when bub won't latch. But then when I do get him to latch several times in a day my nipples end up sore which makes me not want to breastfeed the next feed.
- bub also seems unsettled or hungrier sooner when I breastfeed vs expressed stuff or formula which again makes me worry hes not getting enough. 

But I have taken a step back and am cherishing the time I have with him while he is still so little and we are still trying to breastfeed but im focusing on my mental health and not getting so worked up and feeling like a failure when he is cracking it trying to latch.

They‚Äôve explained they‚Äôd be disappointed if I couldn‚Äôt finish college because of having a kid or disappointed if I ever got pregnant before marriage. 

Well, I haven‚Äôt finished college yet and I‚Äôm not married yet and I don‚Äôt have a place of my own or anything of my own really other than my car, I still live with my family, I‚Äôve only been with my boyfriend 11 months, I don‚Äôt have much saved up, my cars motor is shot currently, I‚Äôm suffering from PTSD and trauma as well, I owe around $3,000 in debt, and I‚Äôm just terrified of what to tell them. 

A little background about my parents: my mom became pregnant with me at 16, married my dad 3 years later and they have been married since, she‚Äôs also suffered through ptsd and trauma from her past and was kicked out by her dad for becoming pregnant (but after I was already born), she‚Äôs very loving and caring but is a storm when she‚Äôs upset or mad. My dad is the biggest concern for me. He has always set high expectations for me and is very strict and I was very sheltered as a child and teen, he‚Äôs very overprotective about anything dangerous or harmful to me, and I‚Äôm afraid of disappointing him the most. 

Things I do have going for me is: My family is very close to one another (but I do isolate myself a lot because I haven‚Äôt told them what‚Äôs happened to me and it was only a year ago and I‚Äôm still trying to cope with it before telling anyone), I‚Äôm in a loving relationship (my boyfriend is scared about the pregnancy but supports me), I just got hired on working for a hospital making $14.50 a hour with benefits and insurance and everything included so I will eventually be able to make this a career. 

Basically what I‚Äôm asking is how can I tell my parents and when should I?

What?! WHAT?!‚Äù and I was so nervous I couldn‚Äôt smile at her and I just kind of stood there then sat down until she handed them to my dad and his first words were, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù (referring to gender).

My mother was so happy she immediately told her mom and her sister and my Aunt cried tears of happiness. My father eventually even commented that it‚Äôs a good thing it‚Äôs happened. In the end, I had nothing to worry about and I stressed myself for nothing. Now that the initial shock is over (and it was over fast), we are all extremely happy and me and my boyfriend are preparing for baby #1.

What can I do to make her labor easier? Yes, I am an official and invited party. My cousin and I are practically sibling and I‚Äôll be godfather. I‚Äôm not basing in, and I know the bulk of labor will be with only her and her husband. 

So I‚Äôm here to ask,  what is the best thing someone did, or you wish they did, when you went into labor?

They already have a go bag in their car with three days clothes.

I‚Äôll be taking a couple pairs of warm wool socks for both to wear after the baby is out, and a card, but that‚Äôs all I can think of. 

Their own home is close by, a ten minute drive with our grandparents living fifteen minutes away. 

Should I get them a hotel room next door to the hospital for rest? Food? Literally any suggestions are welcome :)

708,"I have been seeing a therapist weekly for a couple months now and plan to continue well after baby is born. For the parents out there in a similar situation, I have questions!

How soon after having baby did you resume therapy?

Do you bring the baby with you? If not, who do you leave it with? My husband will be taking some paternity leave but scheduling can sometimes be complex with my therapist. Would it be strange to bring the baby in that type of circumstance? How practical (or not) is that?

I‚Äôve really been benefiting a lot from therapy and think it is important that I continue soon after birth, especially since I‚Äôm a first time mom and am at high risk for PPD. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

TW: SMALL MENTION OF LOSS AHEAD

For me personally, I was pretty sure as a teen and into my early 20s that I wouldn't give birth. I figured if I ever wanted kids that I would adopt. With how the world was, it was more responsible to find a child already out there. Between issues of climate, population, and social responsibility that was the right choice. Never considering how hard or expensive it would be. 

When I realized That I figured okay, none at all then. No big deal. I also never thought myself a wife. So anything ""normal"" sermed out of the way for me in general.

Then I met my now husband and a few years into dating my clock started ticking. Babies looked cuter. The ideals of my youth seemed, while noble, also rooted in fear of one of the biggest changes one can make of thier life. Suddenly I was not scared and Very ready. 

We got and lost a pregnancy. After that I went back and forth from a viewpoint of Well, maybe it isn't supposed to be for me. Maybe young me was right, as I dealt with several years of not getting pregnant. Maybe my hormones got the best of me and I should be thankful biology didn't drive me to a choice I wasn't sure I wanted to make. That was mixed with moments of hope, of ""It will happen. This isn't easy for so many."" Maybe I really have to leave this to fate. I came to feel at peace with either option. I protected my heart. 

Now here I am, married and pregnant. I'm so happy for and in love with this little girl growing inside me. I'm both terrified and excited. When I think back on my journey to this point its amazing how my perspective has grown and changed over the years. How it was influenced. So I wondered how others out there felt.

714,"My husband was ready to have children YEARS before I was. Luckily for me, he's a patient guy and knew I needed a little more time.

A big part of the reason I needed time though, was because it felt like all I heard about was how HARD it is to be pregnant, then to take care of an infant, and how much my life would change.

Even on the different subs here, it feels like a lot of the time it's just people needing to complain or vent (have at it! I'm just saying.)

We're only three and a half weeks out, but I've gotta tell you, this whole thing has been WAY easier than I anticipated. 

Pregnancy was easy peasy- I was able to workout and hike and travel *almost* like I would have before, up until my 38th week. Not even a stretch mark.

Then my labour went super smoothly. It felt so safe and manageable that I didn't even need an epidural. I sure did enjoy the laughing gas though!

And now I have an adorable baby who eats and cries and poops but is overall really easy to take care of. And did I mention adorable?

Don't get me wrong, I know there's a lot of things that have been out of my control and have still gone right to allow this experience to be so much easier than anticipated. And I have an amazing supportive husband who loves helping to take care of baby. AND I'm Canadian so I have a reasonable maternity leave.

But if I had known it could be this easy, I might have done it earlier. 

So if you're unsure, know that it might be super hard. But it also might be way easier than you thought it would be. Good luck future Mamas!

I'll be 28 weeks pregnant on Sunday and I'm having a girl, which I'm so beyond excited and happy about. I could not wait for the gender ultrasound to see what I was having, and once the tech said she was a girl, I couldn't wait to start buying adorable, frilly, girly things for the new baby. 

I went to Walmart that night with my son(5, 4 at the time) &amp; planned on picking out a cute little outfit for her. I get to the baby section and start looking and I get this overwhelming feeling of dread. Something telling me that if I buy the outfit, something bad is going to happen to the baby. Something is going to go wrong.

 I decided not to get anything that day, and basically told myself that I was just being cautious and because of my health and certain conditions and my history, I am high risk. So, I should just wait a bit longer before I start buying things. I decided to wait until the baby was old enough that if she were born, she'd have a good chance of surviving. So 23-24 weeks. 

Well, that time came and went, and I still haven't bought a single thing. I've tried to get myself to buy diapers and stuff, and I can't do it.

That‚Äôs literally 2 days before Christmas. Everyone (family, SO, 9 year old son, etc) keeps telling me that it would be best if we waited until after Christmas due to work schedules and so we can have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Christmas.

2. I‚Äôm miserable with terrible back pain, pelvic pain, and lots of painful Braxton Hicks contractions every night this week. This goes on for a couple hours until I take a super hot shower to try to relax, give up, and go to bed in pain. Doctor does not seem worried about hours of painful Braxton Hicks contractions (often around 5-3 minutes apart) on a regular basis despite a history of preterm labor (son was born healthy at 36+4.) I‚Äôd like to be done with this pregnancy thing ASAP but I also know that I‚Äôll be feeling even worse after delivery AND have a newborn to take care of, so that will be painful and miserable for a while too. 

3. I really really hope things with my SO go back to normal after the baby is born. I‚Äôm almost 37 weeks and we haven‚Äôt been sexual in any way since 20 weeks (my birthday.) We used to be very sexual and affectionate and cuddly and now I‚Äôm lucky if I get a kiss or hug once a day. I KNOW I‚Äôm still attractive despite this big belly.

I just try to focus on those affectionate moments and enjoy them while they last so I can think about them later when I‚Äôm lonely or miserable.

This has been a rough pregnancy since the beginning. I had horrible morning sickness, food aversions that started basically the minute I got pregnant and lasted well into the second trimester. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to be considered HG, but I lost 20 lbs in the first tri, and it was taking a toll on me for sure, because I did not really have it to lose. 

Twice I had cramping and bleeding early on that ended out being a threatened miscarriage, and later diagnosed as a sub chorionic hemorrhage. Once it happened locally and we thought it resolved so I went on a girls trip, and then it happened again. I spent a day in an ER 1000 miles from home and my husband while that got diagnosed. Luckily it resolved itself, but that day in the hospital scared me so badly, and at that time I remember thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a normal pregnancy‚Äù. 

Then the pelvic dysfunction started. I was having a ton of trouble getting around and told my dr. He said it was pretty normal to experience, especially with a large baby (98th%) I reminded him I‚Äôve had a few pelvic injuries in my teens/early 20s and maybe that could be making it worse? he said that yes, it absolutely could, and prescribed physical therapy. Once I got to therapy I learned my SI was so out of line my legs were measuring multiple centimeters different lengths! For a while I could barely walk, and the issue required a number of appointments to manage. It‚Äôs not resolved by any means but It‚Äôs a lot better now. 

I finally felt like I got a break. Yes I was on limited activity due to pain I could only use the stairs once a day, couldn‚Äôt be on my feet more than an hour or two...  but I had some energy back, an appetite, a renewed interest in my husband. I started to nest a little and felt like maybe the rest of my pregnancy would be enjoyable. I even passed my GD test, which they actually gave me early because of baby‚Äôs size and my sugar was completely normal. Blood pressure, fundal height etc all measured perfect and exactly on track. 


Then the ‚Äúlung grapefruit‚Äù started. An intense pressure in my right lower ribcage, that made me short of breath and it was at times extremely painful. I called the dr about it, and they told me it was most likely pregnancy related, likely positional, baby pressuring my diaphragm, ribcage growing etc. OK, I‚Äôm a first time mom, that sounds reasonable enough especially with this monster baby, who was measuring 98th percentile and 4.5lbs at 28 weeks,  of course growing that fast hurts, and I trusted it was nothing to worry about.
The next couple weeks the fatigue got worse and worse. I mentioned it at the dr and it was kind of dismissed as normal pregnancy stuff, especially because I wasn‚Äôt dehydrated and my blood work looked ok except for iron deficiency anemia, which we supplemented. 

I tell myself Doc isn‚Äôt worried, so let‚Äôs just power through. Women have been having babies since the dawn of humanity, and while I wasn‚Äôt having the easiest pregnancy, baby was doing great and it was all just uncomfortable, nothing dangerous or that would be considered a complication. 

 That brings us to 32weeks. I had a good weekend with the husband, and a regular appointment scheduled on Monday. I noticed over the weekend that my heart rate wasn‚Äôt so stable. My smartwatch confirmed it had increased on average but from on the low side of average to a more average average. Nothing insane. Still, it seemed weird so I made a note to mention it at my appointment. Come Monday Doc says it‚Äôs entirely normal for pregnant women‚Äôs heart rate to increase that amount, especially at this stage in pregnancy, as well as to experience non painful palpitations, and some shortness of breath, even the pressure I had been feeling in my ribcage. Well, good enough for me! 

The next day I slept like 20 hours. I was ravenously hungry and completely exhausted and it was all I could do to sleep on the daybed and keep myself fed all day. The next day I felt a little better, and tried to do some things around the house. It was all physically more difficult than I am used to. I felt like I was struggling. My heart rate was high for me but still well within an average range. There was a lot of pressure in my ribs but Doc said that is normal for a big baby.... ok! I power through yet again, trying not to complain too much and just get some things done. 

That night I slept like shit, far worse than just the usual waking up to pee a million times or from pelvic pain . I kept waking up feeling worried and panicky, like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, and like my heart was racing. I figured it was probably just anxiety, which I have dealt with for a long time and have coping mechanisms for, and I‚Äôd call the dr in the morning if I didn‚Äôt feel better.

The next morning I sleep in (super unlike me) and hubs goes to work. I wake up eventually, fix some breakfast and realize I feel really weak, and short of breath. My heart rate was normal for me, but I decide ok enough is enough, I‚Äôm calling the dr, even if it‚Äôs just to be told again that it‚Äôs normal pregnancy stuff, I need the peace of mind. The receptionists tell me he won‚Äôt be in for a while, but will call when he is, and also add ‚Äúif you feel that bad, go to the ER‚Äù it was the first time they had said something like that, but I figured it was just CYA protocol because doc wasn‚Äôt gonna be in for a while. So, I decide I‚Äôm gonna try to wait for the call cause who wants to go to the Er? Plus, I was still pretty sure I was just being a baby about normal, though perhaps on the bad end of normal, pregnancy complaints. 

So I lie down to relax and wait for the call and a few minutes later it feels like someone put a hummingbird in my chest. The weirdest fluttery feeling. Intense but not painful. I look at my watch and my heart rate had jumped from 63 bpm to 123 bpm, while laying down! I call my husband and tell him I need to go to the Er, something is WRONG. 123 isn‚Äôt alarming on its own, when active, but the sudden rate doubling at rest certainly is. 

He rushes home from work to take me. By the time we get there I feel pretty normal, just short of breath. I get triaged and they‚Äôre not sure if I should go to l&amp;d or ER because I‚Äôm pregnant, but not in labor, and it seems like a me problem not a baby problem. Eventually they settle on the ER, because l&amp;d is packed. While I‚Äôm there the Er doc seems pretty convinced it‚Äôs just anxiety, but he‚Äôs willing to do a chest X-ray and cardiac CT. My OB was ok with it, as I was well past the risk of developmental delay for little one, so ok. Do whatever you need to. Those tests were found inconclusive. 

They hook me up to all sorts of monitors and they‚Äôre talking about how it‚Äôs probably anxiety again, I am telling them how yes I am anxious sometimes but this is different. I felt like something was really wrong and I was not ok. I can usually calm my anxiety with breathing exercises, but I couldn‚Äôt breathe well enough to even do them! So they have me wait while more tests and stuff are coming back. then it happens. I get the same flutter in my chest only this time it hurts a little. My husband‚Äôs face drops as he watches the numbers on the monitors climb. People rush in, and finally, the Er doc says that this is not normal, and is not anxiety, and they need to admit me. 

Where do they admit me though? cardiac? Antenatal? ICU? Well, they couldn‚Äôt make up their minds so that‚Äôs basically how it went. I don‚Äôt remember the order I went to each department but it ended with me in the ICU after having dozens of those episodes over the course of a couple hours, my heart rate reached at least 180 during most of them but my high score was 213. I am not kidding when I say it feels like your chest is going to explode when your heart goes that fast. They stuck the paddles on me at one point because I had crossed into afib. I almost passed out a couple times. I puked more than I thought was even possible. I had my first contractions but luckily they subsided and I didn‚Äôt go into labor. They were really worried I would, though, and prepped baby with some steroids to help his lungs out just in case. 

That all was kind of a blur for me, and eventually they got me stable. Baby didn‚Äôt care at all about what was goin on. His heart rate stayed great, and he was kicking and squirming the whole time (which annoyed the maternity nurse who was on baby monitoring duty cause he kept hiding from the monitors, lol) 

It took a little bit to figure out, lots of EKGs, a really uncomfortable heart ultrasound and tons of telemetry. I have SVT, or Supraventricular tachycardia. Basically the blood in the left side of your heart doesn‚Äôt get squeezed out, just cycles inside due to missed signals, and your heart starts pumping harder and faster to try to fix it. It is a fairly common and extremely treatable condition, but their treatment options were limited due to being pregnant. I also didn‚Äôt respond well at all to the first choice medication, because it tanked my BP. 

Eventually they got me stable. It was a very rough night to get there, though. Within 5-6 hours of being stable, I felt great! I had more energy than I had in weeks, if not months, even though I hadn‚Äôt slept. I got moved from the ICU to antenatal so they could keep an eye on baby better as they weaned me off IV medications and switched to oral so I could go home eventually.

I got a shower in antenatal after about 12 hours of stability and it was the best shower of my life. When I got out of the shower I noticed that my skin and eyes looked so much brighter, less sallow and sunken. I hadn‚Äôt noticed how sick I looked until I had my color back, but it was dramatic. I also felt like my brain had been turned back on. I had noticed I was a little foggy but had assumed it was baby brain. 

I now know those were all side effects from the reduced cardiac output I‚Äôd been dealing with for weeks, possibly months. 

All in all, I received fantastic care, and I don‚Äôt blame my care team for ‚Äúmissing‚Äù the SVT issue. I don‚Äôt feel dismissed or ignored. I feel like it was found and treated as soon as they had the information to do so. However, I feel like my desire to not be ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù lead me to dismiss some symptoms that I probably should‚Äôve brought up earlier, or been more persistent about. SVT can be minimally symptomatic, and the symptoms from a minor episode are easily mistakable for normal pregnancy complaints, had I actually complained about all of them, the drs probably would have realized something was up earlier. 

So, now I am considered high risk. Twice weekly NSTs, cardiac meds and monitoring, and lots of biophysical profiles. This far along getting that many specialist appointments in, especially over the holidays was not easy but my docs made room in their schedules for me. 

All of this added up means I now have a c-section scheduled for the 13th of January. I am so very relieved about that. Any one of my complications (Macrosomia, pelvic dysfunction, cardiac problems) would be reason enough on its own to consider a scheduled c. It was my choice to decide between c or induction, but they are absolutely not letting me go past 39 weeks and I have no desire to risk a failed induction and end out needing an emergency c, so there we are.

In first trimester, my appetite was out of control, I ate too much (way beyond recommended daily calories) and I craved and ate unhealthy foods, when my pre-pregnancy diet was typically healthy. Therefore, I am trying not to overeat now, in second trimester, and not to eat the recommended 300 calories a day, just my typical amount.

In the past, I have always gotten away with sending a gift in lieu of attending because so far I have not known any of the honorees very well at work. 

However, being pregnant this time, I definitely debated how it would ‚Äúlook‚Äù if I skipped this one. Assuming my department insists on throwing me a shower in a couple months, I figured it would be rude to skip this shower and then ask other people attend mine. But I really don‚Äôt know this lady at all!! In all honesty, I‚Äôd be fine with not even having a baby shower at work because I just do not like the attention. 

Well, I ended up not attending and sending a gift. Today, someone gave me grief about not being there. They asked how I could possibly think people would attend my shower if I didn‚Äôt go to this one, and how everybody was talking about where I was and why I didn‚Äôt come, and how I must not want a baby shower.

It all seems so early but I think we're getting to the point where we have to pay close attention to the early labor signs because our hospital is an hour and a half away.

Our first born was induced and ended up being a C-section so I have no idea how my body will tell me that it's time. How much time will I have when it finally does decide to tell me that it's time?  I read somewhere that the second baby doesn't always drop before active labor begins and they tend to take less time to come out. I don't know if I'm just psyching myself out because I'm impatient in wanting this baby out of me or if she's really getting ready to come early.

I should be seeing my Dr. this coming Tuesday and I think I'll ask them to do a cervical exam if they weren't already expecting to. My joints are extremely flexible, I've been having Braxton Hicks contractions, lightening crotch is a real thing, and I experience a lot of downward pressure when walking around. I feel like it's really early for all of this to be happening since my first was a week late before we decided to induce. But, like I said, I wouldn't mind her coming early. As long as she's healthy.

My maternity leave starts after 1 more business day, so I'd love to pick up a book or two just to read during some of the ""free time"" I have left and also to help ease some anxiety that I'm afraid is already starting to build back up.

752,"I plan on formula feeding my daughter when she's born, like I did with my first. No, I don't need any advice on if I should breastfeed, I have already made up my mind. There is a medical reason as to why I don't feel comfortable breastfeeding (aggressive antibodies, not enough research showing how they affect the baby) and also am on a lot of medications, some that they say are ""probably"" safe for breastfeeding on, some that they say you shouldn't. And no, I cannot stop taking them unless I want to risk severe withdrawal, possible seizure/death, and a nervous breakdown. Breastfeeding in general just makes me uncomfortable personally, but because of the medical issues I am not willing to ""just try"".

Anyway, my 7.5 year old has IBS-D and had life threatening ulcerative colitis, before I knew they were what was causing her gastro-issues, I switched her to enfamil gentlease, and her eating improved. I also have suspected IBS (the constipation kind) and I'm lactose intolerant, which lead to severe colic as a baby and my boyfriend is gluten sensitive. Enfamil gentlease is gluten free and it worked really well with my first so that's what I intend to try first with my LO when I get induced in 28 days.

So, earlier today, I called the maternity ward where I am getting induced to see if they have gentlease on hand for me or if I will have to bring it myself. I explained I would be getting induced in less than a month and wanted to know if they had it because that was what I intended on using. The nurse who answered the phone told me to hold on and asked someone if they still had it. She got back on the phone and said they do have it, but I will have to special request it. I asked if I needed to do it ahead of time or when I got there, she said when I come to get induced is fine. Then she said ""But wait, we're going to want you to breastfeed, is there some reason why you can't?"" I explained that I am on medications not safe for breastfeeding and she said okay and we ended things there.

I'm now worried that they will try to force me to breastfeed, or refuse to bring me formula or the right type of formula in a ploy to make me breastfeed. The way she said ""we're going to want you to breastfeed"" made me feel like they won't give me a choice in the matter. This has me very nervous. Should I have my OBGYN write an order for gentlease due to our family history of gastric issues and also so they can't deny me formula? Should I bring bottles/nipples/formula with me in case they refuse to give me formula? Formula is expensive and I would rather use the free formula at the hospital for the 5 days she will be there if I can, and right now I only have 32 oz containers of liquid formula, which will be really heavy in my go-bag.

Car mirror: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9EZ5LG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9EZ5LG) Expensive, but worth it. Keeps baby entertained/distracted when he's having a fussy time in the car. works in the dark too because it has lights.

WhiteNoise/Nightlight: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XMRCC94](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XMRCC94) I love this thing. you can set a timer so you dont even have to worry about turning it on and off. it has ""favorites"" that you can easily touch through. it has an ""ok to wake"" feature for when baby gets older, the light will change colors at a certain time to let kiddo know he can get up  (which seems like a cool feature to me, but i havent gotten there yet lol)

Wyze cam: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076H3SRXG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076H3SRXG) we use this as our nanny cam. Cheap, and does what we need it to do.

I wish it had toys that hung over the top, but i use the one from my pack and play, which attaches just fine on the sides. Plus everybody rages about this thing anyway, you prob should just get one.

Freemie: if you pump, seriously. do yourself a favor. First of all you have GOT to get a portable one. No body wants to waste hours of the day sitting in a chaiir lke youre glued to it. those were probably the most miserable days of my maternity leave.

Note on thermometers:

Thermometer - apparently the infared  Temple- easy to scan fancy thermometers dont work on young babies because their head's cant temperature control as much yet at an early age. Get one of the cheapo thermometers that you can put under his/her armpitor in their bum for the first few months.

Bassinett - Straight into the crib you go little fella

I have a very small YouTube channel (won't link here. want to be anonymous on Reddit. I think that's against the rules anyway I do not want to spam. no interest in promoting my dumb videos) I vlog my pregnancy and nobody watches it but my friends and family. I made it mainly because I have family all over the country and thought it would be fun to keep the pregnancy progress documented. YouTube has these features where you can see where your traffic sources are coming from. I've been gaining subscribers as my belly gets bigger and I notice they are all men. When I look at their channels, their content are all curated playlists of other very small YouTube channels like mine with women vlogging their pregnancies. I just found one of my videos in a playlist titled ""large pregnant bellies"". YouTube has a feature where you can see how people are finding your videos, and like all of my non-friends and family views are from searches like ""pregnant belly"". I'm developing a following of pregnancy fetishists. I'm never sexual, I usually just mimic a lot of other pregnancy vlogs I like to watch and talk about symptoms, what I've been buying for the baby, and do a quick belly shot. 

This might sound stupid, but I was really surprised to see pregnant belly fetishes being so common? Like I'm getting weirdly fascinated with how the heck all these people are finding me because I'm such a nobody on the internet. I don't think I'm anything special either like some growing internet sensation. My videos aren't particularly good. When I look at my subscribers' other subscribed channels, they follow a lot of regular pregnant women who have like 5 subscribers and similar low effort vlogs. There seems to be a lot of people who do this. Like they are obsessed with pregnant bellies? 

I'm just thinking a site like YouTube can tell you who is watching and how they are finding you, but other websites don't. Just be careful with how you share online and keep that in mind. Even if it seems like an obscure corner of the internet, you aren't popular, don't think what you're up to is a common fetish, and don't think a lot of people see what you put out there, its  possible that they are.

774,"I (31F, 2nd pregnancy) am not a stressed person, normally, so I hope it is only because of the pregnancy hormones that I feel that way, but these days I fell always stressed! Not because of the pregnancy itself or because of work, but more because of every little thing that I can‚Äôt control and also I realised that my family is stressing me. This was not the case with my first pregnancy, but they say they are all different. 

I don‚Äôt think that it is depression. I am not sad and I don‚Äôt cry (not for that). It really is this stress feeling like electricity in my veins, my brain that won‚Äôt shut up and always think about the little stuff. The result is that I have zero patience with people and everyone makes me angry. 

I talked about it last week with my husband and since then, I feel more calm with him and my daughter. 

But I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to my mother and father about the way they make me stress. 

My father had an operation this week and expects me to visit him this week-end. It is not far away, but now I have to change my plans for the w-e and it stresses me and I am afraid I will not be able to complete everything I want to do this w-e. But I can‚Äôt complain about the stress it causes me because I will feel so selfish. He is in the hospital and I am complaining. 

My mom... where do I begin... always stresses me. I feel like she always judges me. ¬´¬†it‚Äôs getting late, you should put baby to sleep or she will not have enough sleep¬†¬ª, ¬´¬†we are having fun and she does not want to take a nap. She doesn‚Äôt need a nap¬†¬ª, ¬´¬†I wanted you to come for supper, can you cancel your other plans¬†¬ª, and when we talk, she always tells me that I talk rude to her (maybe because she stresses me). Alway little inocent stuff, but it stresses me. I feel like the ungrateful daughter because she sacrificed so much for me and was a single mother. 

My doctor only told me to try to sleep more. Maybe I did not explain how much it affects me. I‚Äôll put more emphasis on this aspect on my next appointment. 

Does anyone feel the same way? How do you deal with it? Will it go away after birth?

775,"I have a message in to my doctor that has handled my thyroid issues and I plan to ask my OBGYN as well, but I wanted to see if anyone here has any relevant experiences. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid condition early this year. It's always been very mild -- I caught it early because when I start noticing symptoms I get super focused and don't give up until I find an answer, apparently -- and has actually improved in the past 6 months or so. In June my TSH was around 3.6 with thyroid antibodies around 278. I just got my numbers done in mid-November and my TSH is down to 2.6 (it fluctuates anyway depending on whether or not I'm in a flare) and antibodies were down to 178, T3 and T4 were both normal.

Anyway, I'm about 8 weeks pregnant and have of course been planning to get a flu shot (I know I'm a bit late -- shit got busy there for a little while), but I've got myself worried that the shot could cause a flare of my Hashi's and whether or not that could hurt the baby.

I'm at 11 weeks, and I know this may be early to think about now, but I am wondering if anyone here uses cloth diapers and would recommend them? How exactly does it work, I know they come with liners, is that all you need to wash?

My fiancee's (23f(I 24M) period has been a week late according to her period/ovulation app. She decided last night to use an EPT to check what was going on. The test read positive but it had been expired for a year. We decided to go get some new ones after realizing the fact. She took one this morning and it tested positive on one of the brand new ones.

 We dont want to announce anything to either of our folks till we are 100% sure. The problem is, she is on her parents ins still and has no current ins card in her possession. I have my own insurance through my employment but she isnt added onto it. I will have to check today if I can add someone that isnt a spouse (yet) and if i can do it before my plan ""renews"". 

Should we schedule a doctor's appointment straight away? If so, at a primary care phys or a specialist? Should we hold off on the doctor and wait a certain period of time and then take another test?

I'm a  pharmacist and clinical researcher and have worked and studied really hard for my career. Earlier this year, right before I found out I was pregnant, I was about to start my thesis but had to put everything on hold when the first trimester hit me really hard. I was also advised to stay away from lab work due to the nature of the samples that I work with. 

Seeing my husband move forward in his career has made me jealous. I've talked to him about this before and we always come to the conclusion that right now, our priority is our baby girl and that we'll revisit the idea of me going back to work and/or school when she's 6 months old.

I am 28 years old and 14 weeks pregnant with my second child. I have had chronic hypertension since I was 22, first pregnancy went well was induced at 36 weeks 6 days due to high blood pressure but baby girl is perfectly fine. 

This September I found out I was pregnant with my second. I live in a smaller town and due to that I see a specialist in a larger city about 12 hours away for my hypertension. I told her I was pregnant and they ordered an echocardiogram to see how my heart was doing. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs functioning at 45 percent and my left ventricle is enlarged. I have had to travel a few times to see a cardiac ob she has told me that I will have to deliver there and be there at 36 weeks. She also would like me to start a medication for my heart that has not been approved for pregnancy.

I have been feeling so terrible lately I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I have not started the medication because I am waiting to get a second opinion another doctor thinks my heart function is ok but my left ventricle is still a concern. I am so excited to have another child but I do feel so guilty for getting pregnant it was not planned. I have no energy due to being pregnant and the medication I am on (which is pregnancy safe) I just feel tired, sad and stressed out. On top of it all having to deliver so far way from home will be a huge stressor and financial strain we do have savings thank god! Hopefully this feeling will pass.

Anyways, I am a first time mommy to a beautiful boy who is now 1 month old. So far, everything has gone by the books. He is breastfeeding, latches fine. I pump at night to make sure I produce enough (pediatricians idea as DS was 3 weeks early and had jaundice the first week). Aside from the occasional bout of cluster feeding, he‚Äôs been great and not too fussy at all. 
Up until 2 days ago, his poop was yellow and seedy, and he was pooping 6-9 times per day, usually an hour or so after feedings. 2 days ago, he had a few very runny poops and one poop that was a deep green. That night his poops were back to normal so I didn‚Äôt worry too much. Yesterday he had a few poops that were mostly yellow but with a bit of green mixed in. Today his poops have been brown and green, sometimes with a bit of the yellow, and smellier than they‚Äôve ever been before. In addition, today he seems very congested. He‚Äôs pooped immediately after (or even during) all of his feedings, and is constantly hungry. I‚Äôm not sure if he was not eating enough because of the congestion or if the breast milk is going right through him. Earlier, after he ate, I pumped to se what I had left and it was only 30ML. Tonight before bed I pumped 120ML which is what has been normal the past week. 
He has slept and had calm moments throughout the day, so he‚Äôs not extremely fussy, although he is fussier than usual. I did use the bulb and saline to clear his nose and mucus did come out.

My question is, does this all seem normal or does it seem like he may be sick? And if he‚Äôs sick, is it okay to call the pediatrician in the morning or should I call the emergency number tonight? 

Update: this morning we are back to the yellow seedy poop. He still seems congested but that could be weather related. I am still going to call the pediatrician once they open. Thank you everyone for your advice and support! ",Is my 1 month old sick or am I just being a paranoid first time mom?,1

It is supposed to be nice for a 2am diaper blow out to just be able to rip one set off and have the bottom set ready to go.  Do people do this with newborns right away?

2. Is there a size diaper below 1?  My Doctor said my baby will probably be small, like in the 6-7lb range.  Did your baby start out with size 1 or did you use a newborn size?  
3. The diaper bag has a change of clothes, a hoodie, a blanket, diapers, wipes and a plastic bag in it.  Am I missing anything?  The wipes seem to be the heavy part.  Are you lugging around a whole container or do you have a chunk of them in a baggie?  
4. I am thinking about having a can of formula on hand just in case.  If you live within a couple miles of a grocery store, do you really think it is worth the pre-purchase just in case breast feeding is a disaster the first few days or am I better to wait to see if it is needed.

I was a bit excited, because I want to move things along and I wanted to find out if I'm dilated at all. I have seen my OB for every appointment, and I really like and trust her.

So my husband and I are sitting in the exam room waiting for my OB, and in walks some stranger. She introduces herself and says she's a resident working with my OB and that she'll be doing my appointment. 

I was so thrown! I wasn't expecting that at all. I ended up declining the sweep even though I really wanted it, because I just felt really weird about a stranger doing it, so I didn't end up finding out if I'm dilated or not either, which was really disappointing (my OB doesn't do cervical checks at every appointment unless you ask for them). 

So she takes my blood pressure and it's high. Which it never has been before. She says she'll do the rest of the checks and try again. So she checks the heartbeat, fundal height, etc. Then redoes my blood pressure and it's still high. So she dims the lights and tells me to lie down and relax and that she'll be back in a bit to try again. When she comes back she comes with my OB who is the one who takes my blood pressure this time and it's much better. My OB is still worried though, and asked me to go to the hospital for a NST, and blood work. 

I go to the hospital and I end up there for two hours while they run these tests and check my blood pressure repeatedly. Every time they check it it's good, and all the tests come back normal. 

Honestly, I'm convinced that my blood pressure was high at my appointment because they just threw a random resident at me with no warning, and I was upset and disappointed. I'm not good with last minute changes to my plans/expectations and I really feel like they should have given me a heads up instead of just springing it on me. And they should have realized when my actual OB took my blood pressure and it was good that maybe I just wasn't comfortable with the resident.

1. ECV - I've heard very mixed things and even the doc said it only works about 50% of the time. She did say my fluid levels were good and placenta was in a good location, so it \*might\* work
2. Wait and see what happens when I go into labor. Either baby will have flipped by then and I can have her vaginally, or we'll need a c-section anyway. This doesn't sound ideal to me.

* **What** it is? This postpartum brace normally costs $170USD yet cost me zero dollars. Thank you, Tricare! This is a belly binder with special attachments like perineal support straps, undergarment inserts (this brace can be worn AS underwear, not just on top of panties), custom fit ice packs, etcetera.

* **How** to get one? Again - this post is a PSA for those with Tricare Prime. You need to download and print the prescription form from Hometown Medical Equipment. Go to [https://www.htmedicalequipment.com](https://www.htmedicalequipment.com) and click on ""Our Prescription"" at the top of the page. Your doctor will need to sign this form - you do NOT need a separate rx from your doctor's prescription pad.
* **Sizing**? The MamaStrut website gives sizing instructions, I followed those and self-measured myself to be a medium. [https://www.mamastrut.com/sizing-care/](https://www.mamastrut.com/sizing-care/) My under-the-bump horizontal circumference is 39"" and right now I do fit into bottoms that are generally medium also.

Our doctor recommended doing something called a Sequential Screen which has two parts, one that we'd do around 12 weeks (ultrasound and blood draw), and another between 15 and 21 weeks that is just a blood draw. It says this screens for Trisomy 18 &amp; 21 (which seems redundant if we do NIPS?) as well as neural tube defects.

There is also a more extensive test called Inheritest - Society Guided Panel that tests for a ton of stuff (sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and hemoglobins C, D, E, O, Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, fanconi anemia group C, Fragile X syndrome, Gaucher disease, Mucolipidosis type IV, Niemann-Pick disease types A&amp;B, spinal muscular atrophy, and Tay-Sachs). Again, this is normally $2,900 but through the genetic testing company it's $299.

Basically, I'm lost here. I don't entirely know what a lot of these disorders are or how common or even serious they would be if detected. If we do NIPS (which we're pretty much 100% on), which other screening seems to be the logical addition? I'd appreciate any help/guidance/resources you can offer!",Genetic Testing - Overwhelmed???,1

863,"Nolan was born today via c-section. It was nicely pretty uneventful. We chose to do a c-section due to complications that I had with my first birth and the forecasted size being bigger than my first. 

We arrived at 8 am, and they started prepping me for surgery. Shaved me and put in the IV. They also put in the catheter at that time as I have a joint condition that allows me to easily subluxate my hips and we were concerned about what would happen if they put it in after the spinal block was working. It was uncomfortable, but no big deal. 

They then took me to the operating room. I received my spinal block at that time. And while it was a little painful, it wasn't horrendous. I had to hunch over like they were giving me an epidural and it kicked in pretty quickly. They checked me for numbness and we were good to go.

They sterilized my stomach, put in the sterile field and put up the tent. Once they started cutting, it was only 15 minutes until he was born. And boy was he mad!! It was weird to feel them moving me around as they were cutting and yet feel no pain. 

He did swallow some fluid on his way out, so he spent some time with the team off to the side to make sure he was breathing fine. 

They then started putting me back together. During the delivery of the placenta, I started to get stabbing pains on my right side up by the underside of my boob. It was fairly painful and caused by my body transferring the pain signals. A bit of morphine and I was good. 

They finished stitching me up and then I was able to hold my son. I am not yet 24 hours out, but i am feeling pretty good. A little nausea, but pain is well managed. I am currently sitting up in a chair and gerting ready to catch a nap. üòä

The school nurse offered my kid this type of vomit bag the last time he was sick at school, and I immediately saw that these were a big improvement over my standard paper bags.

These [vomit bags](https://pukebag.com/50-pack-emesis-bag-disposable-vomit-bags) doesn't store completely flat when unused, but it's still pretty small for storing in luggage, a purse, or a glove compartment. I also keep one tucked into each rear passenger door compartment, since my kids have a tendency to be carsick (could be my driving, but still...). When these bags are extended, they are long and thin enough to prevent splashing---and the plastic is way better than paper in assuring no leaks and no soak-through. Biggest bonus with this brand: the plastic rim not only keeps the bag ""open"" while you're sick, it has slits to secure the closed bag when you're done.

The first time someone tried to grabbed stomach was when I was 8 weeks along, *not even showing*. At that time I was still wrapping my head around it (as I said, it came as a surprise). My boyfriend's mom did it out of no where and as a result I had a full-on panic attack over it. She was shocked that I backed away and that I was upset about it, and ultimately accused me of not wanting her involved in the baby's life. Now at 29 weeks, I've learned that people are going to do it without consent and how to kindly tell them I don't want to be touched, at least not without a warning or permission.

However, I'm still having issues with some people grabbing and squeezing my stomach out of no where. I think the manner that it is done overwhelms me and results in me getting anxiety. I've reminded them multiple times to please ask, yet a few will just respond with ""oh get used it!"" and continue grabbing me.. But I really can't just get used to it!

888,"I had an ECV at 37w and thought I would share as when researching it online I didn't find that many 'helpful' accounts of the procedure. Bear in mind this was carried out in the UK so it may differ slightly elsewhere.

As a bit of background, I've been under Midwife only care throughout my pregnancy and breech was first suspected at 31w but by my 34w appointment they still weren't sure if it was head down or not. (they don't scan at midwife appts). At 36+3 I went for a presentation scan with the midwife who confirmed with a quick scan that baby was indeed breech. I was booked in for another scan and possible ECV for 37w. 

I arrived at the hospital at 37+0w and the sonographer did a detailed scan (my first proper scan since 20w). She took measurements of everything and estimated the baby to be 6lb 6oz. Fluid levels were good so they sent us up to the Labour ward to wait for the consultant. I had a private room for the procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

After meeting with the consultant who was happy that based on baby size and fluid levels I was a good candidate for the ECV, they hooked me up to the fetal CTG monitor for around 30mins and took my BP. Baby was happy so they were happy to proceed. They gave me the muscle relaxant in my side near the uterus. I asked if there could be any side effects to the drug and whilst she said no, I did start to feel jittery and anxious which I'd read could happen.

&amp;#x200B;

 Two doctors (one male, one female), a med student who observed and the midwife were present for the procedure. The midwife got the gas and air ready just in case I felt like I needed it. The told me it is not a painfree procedure but that people's experience vary wildly. For reference I am 5ft 6 and currently approx 148 lb (started out at 128lb). They told me they would stop at any time on my command if I felt I couldn't tolerate the pain. They scanned me again and felt where the baby was to work out which way they were going to rotate.  Head was under my left ribs so they planned to go head down my left side and bottom up the right side. 

&amp;#x200B;

The male doctor got a grip of both the head and bottom and started to turn - they had put a lot of gel on to reduce the friction but it was really quite uncomfortable. The other doctor scanned throughout my husband and midwife had to keep telling me to breathe as it was really quite painful and the doctor was using a lot of force to turn the baby. I was shaking quite a bit but didn't use the gas and air - mainly because I couldn't actually move to reach it and the doctor had one leg on the bed for leverage! They got baby head down but it immediately flipped back. It did this twice so they had me empty my bladder for the third attempt. They asked me if I wanted to try again and I agreed. The third attempt was successful but they had to move the bed  to have me sitting up halfway through the turn to try and wedge baby in place. They also held the head in place for a couple of minutes to ensure it stayed that way which was confirmed with another scan. They said it was very unusual that the baby flipped back twice. They also said that they wouldn't have tried any more  if it had flipped back. the third and final time was bar far the most painful.

&amp;#x200B;

They put me on the monitor for another 20 minutes to ensure that the baby was ok.  Although baby didn't move during this time it's heart rate was normal and they were happy to let me go. I did express concern that I thought the baby had flipped back but they said they wouldn't scan again as they wouldn't have tried another attempt. They had already booked me in for a scan 3 days later anyway so said to wait until then.

I have a scan tomorrow to check if the baby is still head down. I have everything crossed that it is but something in my gut is telling me it's breech again. If this is the case and they offer me another ECV, I will decline. I'm glad I tried it once but I wouldn't try it a second time for this baby. I'd try it again in another pregnancy as whilst it was painful, I found it bearable.

I made a post a few days ago about how I ended up in the ER due to a severe headache that lasted several days, spots in my vision, nausea, head/heart pounding, etc. This hospital was not equipped for pregnant women (which is ridiculous, but whatever) and the doctor on call said he would try and help but he wasn't sure what to do. Their tests indicated that my protein levels were elevated along with my glucose. However, my blood pressure was--and has been--perfect. This is a lot different from my last pregnancy where I experienced very high blood pressure and pre-e. It's also confusing because I am still experiencing the feeling of a racing heart every day, and when I went to my appointment yesterday my blood pressure was fine but my pulse was 100+. According to the doctor, this can be normal, but she asked for blood and urine samples just to be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

After I got to work today, I started getting sick. Nausea, dizziness, racing heart (I sit at a desk so it's not like I'm doing a bunch of physical activity). At some points today, I've felt like passing out. This is all stuff that's been happening regularly the last several days. I wrote in to my doctors office asking if my test results were back yet. They called me and said that my results were great and that they were ""confident I was fine"". I thanked them and they hung up. They did not share the results and the results have not been posted on my online account. Out of curiosity, I took a peek at other test results from earlier in pregnancy. From what I can see, my protein has been elevated for at least a month and was marked ""abnormal"". However, the doctor's comments in their review said everything was normal. I also noticed my platelets are low among a few other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't ever bring these things up with a doctor because I obviously don't have a medical degree and I don't want to overstep or be ""one of those people"", but I'm frustrated that I've felt (and am still feeling) incredibly sick and am being told I'm fine. I've even had light spotting this weekend and they glossed over that and did not address it. It makes me feel like I'm stupid, or weak. I don't want to look like a crazy person going into L&amp;D like ""apparently my urine and blood are fine but I'm here to waste your time with all these possibly normal pregnancy symptoms!""

An excerpt of the site.

Screening tests

There are 3 types of screening test for Down syndrome: the combined first trimester screening, the¬†non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and the second trimester maternal serum screening.

Combined first trimester screening

The combined first trimester screening test is done between 9 weeks and 13 weeks (plus 6 days) into the pregnancy to calculate the risk of a number of abnormalities, including Down syndrome. It is safe for both mother and baby. There will be a cost, but you can claim some of it back from¬†Medicare.

A computer is used to combine results from 2 tests:

A¬†blood test, done between 9 and 12 weeks into the pregnancy, looks for hormonal changes that can suggest there is a problem with the baby‚Äôs chromosomes.An¬†ultrasound scan, done at 12 to 13 weeks into the pregnancy, measures the thickness of fluid behind the baby‚Äôs neck, called the nuchal translucency. This is often larger in babies with Down syndrome.

These results, combined with the mother‚Äôs age, show the risk of Down syndrome. If the baby is at increased risk, you will be offered a diagnostic test, which is optional, to confirm whether or not the baby has Down syndrome.

Edit 2: thanks to a user I'm learning that autisum and down syndrome are not the same. I'm learn so I'm sorry for the communication confusion. ",Postive screening for autism at 17 weeks,1
898,"So on November 5th, I found out that I was pregnant. A suprise for sure since my boyfriend and I are still on the young adult side but a welcome one nonetheless. Got a urine sample from my regular doctors office that confirmed the pregnancy. They went to draw my blood however the nurse who did it pricked me 3 times and was unable to get it. She apologized (no biggie, it happens!) but reminded me that I would need a blood work on file to see an OB but I ended up leaving with a referral to a local OB.  In hindsight I shouldve known from the start that my usual doctors office not being able to get my blood wouldve been a bad foot to start off on lmao

Anyways, I Called the OB the next day, they again told me that I needed a blood test done so they specifically told me to go to a nearby blood lab to have it done. Go in the next day, get drawn right away (also want to praise the lady who took my blood she got it right away lol). They told me to wait 24 hours to give the OB a call back so they could process it but also told me that since its the weekend to just wait until Monday. Did just that, called them back and they did not answer. Called back on Tuesday and got a run of the mill response ""Sorry we're really busy right now, we'll give you a call in the morning"". No call from them at on Wednesday, so I called again on Thursday. They claimed that they had nothing on file for me but that they would call back the blood lab to see what was up aka ""We'll call you back later"". Zero calls for the rest of the week. 

Today I finally snapped, I have waited almost 2 weeks which is quite a bit of time for them to reach out the me while also calling them every other day to see what was going on. This morning as soon as I woke up I got them on the phone, expalined the long wait and told them That I was very frustrated -- I initially found out I was pregnant exactly a month ago and began the process exactly a month ago there shouldnt be any reason for me to be still waiting now on Dec 5th. At all. The lady, bless her, tried to give me another ""we'll call you back"" but I shut her down and demanded that I get an answer as to why I havent been called back or anything. She put me on hold and said she would be calling the blood lab to see whats up. 

Oh my god, when I say I saw red after this, Im not lying.

She took me off hold and claimed that the lab never got any blood work from me. Full stop.

Bitch, what? 

Got off the phone with her and called up the blood lab ASAP. They told me the same thing again, ""oh we never got anything from you"" and tried to ""call me back later in the day if anything changes"" refused that line again, told them that Im more than happy to be put on hold until they figure it out. Turns out with a little pressure, they eventually found my blood work. In the end my supposed OB office never turned in a work order to them, despite telling me to go to them, and then also ghosted the blood lab as well! The lab lady told me that they had called them 3 days in a row that week after I had gotten it done (so again, a whole month ago!). I then asked if it were possible to still have my results sent to my supposed OB but the blood is now too old for anything to be done to it. At this point on the phone, Im holding back angry tears but I still apologize to the lab lady and told her that I wasnt mad at her or anything. 

So now Im back to square 1 and super upset. 

Fuck that OB office. I feel like its super unprofessional what they did. I mean, Im pregnant so Im kinda a priority at an OB (not to sound vain but you all know what I mean) so I cant imagine if they were like some cancer lab where the blood results needed to be looked at ASAP. Lord forbid at this office you actually need some answers. Fuck.",OB has been giving me the runaround and now the blood labrotory has lost my results! I am fuming!!!!,1

906,"So, a little background...In October of 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 3 (HER2+, ER/PR-) breast cancer. I was ""lucky"" in that, while very aggressive, what I had was currently the easiest to target and fight. After 6 rounds of chemo, surgery, and radiation I was deemed cancer free in May of 2017. However, I was told by my OBGYN that my hormone levels were the lowest they could get and that she wouldn't even try to conceive naturally because it likely wouldn't happen and would just be stressful and disappointing. She said I should go straight to IVF with the eggs that we froze before I started chemo. After that discussion my husband and I threw caution to the wind and stopped using condoms, why bother, right? That discussion was on February 23rd and on March 19th I was calling her back to make an appointment to confirm I was indeed pregnant after getting several positives at home. Needless to say she was skeptical and hesitant to use the word ""pregnant"", but I was!! ( side note, I ended up changing doctors since she would never give me information about the pregnancy and after 3-4 ultrasounds she still hadn't given me even an estimated due date).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last Tuesday, November 27th. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went in for my 39 week appointment with my doctor and he decided we could induce since my BP had been going up and was currently 144/89, my swelling was worse, and, honestly, I was just done. So, we were scheduled for a 3:00AM induction Wednesday morning! Not going to lie, I was a combination of crazy excited to finally be getting the show on the road and nervous about being induced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wednesday Morning

03:00 arrives and we are at the hospital waiting to be taken back to a room. Once they got an insurance issue figured out we were shown our room and my nurse got started hooking me up and getting everything ready. At 04:30, when checked, I was sitting at 2cm (about the same for the last 2-3 weeks). Pitocin was started low at 04:45 and after about an hour or so the contractions started getting pretty intense. By 07:30 the contractions were more than I could handle and I asked for the epidural ( I had wanted to wait as long as I could lol). Of course, when I finally asked for it the anesthesiologist was doing a c-section so I had to wait about 30 minutes. According to my husband I was pretty incoherent by that time! Sorry, love!! I just remember laying there with my one leg propped up and rubbing my fist up and down my thigh really hard to try and get through the pain. At 08:00 the epidural went in and my water broke at 08:45. At this point I was dilated to 8cm and feeling great! When my water broke the nurse said that there was meconium in the fluid which meant that the NICU team would need to be on hand to check out baby and make sure that her lungs were clear. By 10:00 I was fully dilated and my doctor gave the go ahead to start practice pushing. Once we were fully ready to deliver, my doctor had to be called 3 times before he showed up for delivery. I started pushing with my doctor there around 12:00, somewhere around 6 pushes later and my baby girl was born! 

&amp;#x200B;

Cora Giselle came into this world at 12:17pm on Wednesday, November 28th, weighing 7lbs 5oz and was 20 inches long. Induction from start to finish was about 8 hours! The NICU team checked her out and gave her the all clear with APGAR's of 9. She was brought back to me for skin to skin after about 10 minutes (maybe less, but it felt like FOREVER!). I ended up with a second degree tear and stitches, but according to my doctor and the nurse it was a ""small tear"". We were able to go home Friday afternoon, my doctor offered Thursday, but we wanted the extra day of help! 

&amp;#x200B;

Breastfeeding has been a struggle since I'm working with only one breast; the left had a small chance of producing, but has done nothing yet. Overall I had a great experience and am so glad that we went with the induction instead of waiting her out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm leaving things out and am sure that I have, but the most important thing is that my baby is here, happy, and healthy!

Could use some help.  Apparently, last year (October 2017), I agreed to two different genetic tests (Maternit21 and Panorama).

They have told me that my insurance denied the claim as not medically necessary, and that they have a year to bill me, so I am responsible for the due amount.  However, before I had the genetic testing done, I contacted my insurance and was assured the testing would be covered, but that I would be responsible for my deductible (except I had already met my out of pocket max at this point).  Basically, insurance is saying this isn't covered (even though they previously said genetic testing was covered due to my advanced maternal age and family history), Natera is saying I owe this money, and I can't seem to figure out what's accurate.  From the googling I've done, it looks like Natera has incredibly shady billing practices, and people have been able to negotiate payments much lower than they were billed (closer to $200).

918,"Hi all! About to head into our 3rd night at home with baby, and thought I would share my experience as I'd enjoyed reading everyone else's.

I'm in Canada, and chose to go with a midwife- here they require a specialized degree and extensive medical training, can prescribe drugs, etc. After discussing options, I made a Birth Centre my first choice. I have some fear of feeling like a number or ""forgotten"" in hospitals, and was worried about being pushed into things I did not want, etc. After a tour, I decided the birth centre would be perfect-  the rooms have huge tubs, queen sized adjustable beds, birthing stools, private bathrooms with showers, even a (faux) fireplace. TENS and laughing gas are available there, but as no doctors are on staff (you must come with a midwife from an affiliated clinic) there are no epidurals or C-Sections. A transfer to the hospital is available, quick, and nearby if needed (they have a close relationship with the hospital).

&amp;#x200B;

My water broke spontaneously before any labor or contractions. It actually happened while I was listening to one of those cheesy hypnobirthing type meditations- you know, the ""you're lying on a beach...so comfortable...your contractions are beautiful and welcome and so natural...."" type. I actually had an audible pop and huge gushes, which I'm told doesn't happen as often as it does in the movies. My midwife had instructed me to call her in the morning if something like this happened (unless the water wasn't clear or I was in labor), so I tried to get some rest (ha). At 6am, early labor began. Contractions felt like really bad food poisoning or period cramps at this point and were mostly bearable. I was kind of wondering why they didn't hurt more. At 1pm, the midwife came to check me and I was 3cm dilated. She told me to labor at home some more, and call me when things changed- that I'd know it when they did. While checking, she did a small stretch ""while she was up there"".

&amp;#x200B;

I think the stretch definitely hurried things. I got into my tub and started having much stronger contractions that I needed to moan through, not just breathe. Within an hour, DH and I were driving to the birth centre to meet her. The car ride was so awful. I was gripping and writhing through the contractions, and could feel every tiny bump in the road.

&amp;#x200B;

After arriving, she checked me again - 5cm. I decided to labor in the room's tub and things got intense very quickly. The contractions were coming every 2-3 minutes and were so, so strong- I felt like I didn't know how I would ever do this, why we were built this way, if I would actually make it through this without requesting to go to the hospital and get an epidural. Breathing helped but I felt so deeply lost and just ""surviving"" each one as best I could, with shorter and shorter breaks. I started throwing up a lot between and sometimes during the contractions. DH had learned all kinds of massage and helping techniques and we didn't end up using any of them- in the moment I just didn't want to be touched or have the distraction. I loved having him there though, just to be beside me and support me. The midwife suggested I try out the nitrous oxide in the room- it's mixed with 50% oxygen and you administer it yourself by breathing into a mask. I took her suggestion (I'd have tried anything) and really just the ritual of having to breathe into it helped a lot. I couldn't really feel any other effects (no high or dizziness) but it seemed to help a bit with the pain. It definitely didn't take it away though. After 2 hours or so, she checked again and I was fully dilated, which is crazy fast and explains why things were so intense.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it was time to push and she helped me move onto the bed. I honestly was not mentally ready to push and was feeling quite spent, but I figured we were at the point where we just needed to get this done. There was no more thought in my mind that we could transfer or get an epidural or anything else- this was it. We used a birth stool to let gravity help out a bit. The contractions were still painful, but at least I wasn't just surviving them- I had a job. Some advise against it, but I pretty much 100% ""purple pushed""- I gave it absolutely everything I had, teeth gritted, full body, no holds barred. It took about 40 minutes, but actually felt like less. I couldn't believe it when I actually pushed our son out, that it was over and I had gotten through it. I was in complete shock from the experience for a little while. It was hard to even process that I was a mom now, that I was holding my baby. My husband had that ""overwhelming love"" moment (he cried when he came out!) but all I could think about was processing what had happened and relief that it was over. We did skin to skin, and our son was absolutely perfect. He came out calmly and was able to nurse right away pretty easily (wish that continued, it's SO difficult sometimes!). I was lucky enough to avoid tearing. Recovery so far has been decent. I'm glad I swallowed my pride and bought Depends! Don't skip this!

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm really happy that everything went according to plan and that we're all healthy and well.  When I think about the birth, I'm really just in shock and awe that \*I\* did that, and that so many other women have as well. A positive and humbling experience, but I'd have to have a heavy dose of that birth amnesia I hear about to consider doing it again anytime soon.

I am 15 weeks and about two weeks ago I started getting small fluttering twitches in my upper abdomen directly under my right rib. It feels a lot like an eye twitch and is usually like 10-15 twitches in a row. It was occasional at first but the past two days it has been nearly constant. I might go 5-10 minutes tops in between another bout of the spasms. They are not painful at all, but they are robbing me from being able to relax. 

I drink about 5-8 bottles of water a day, stretch daily, and eat pretty damn healthy. I am on prenatal vitamins and I've tried hot water and a heating pad to make them stop. I'm starting to feel like I'm just going to have to deal with them at this point and hope they go away at some point during the pregnancy.

925,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am fairly new to /r/BabyBumps but have stopped by this subreddit for some advice in the past. My wife and I recently conceived a child and are expecting to give birth at the end of February. While we are excited for our new bundle of joy, it was a bit unexpected. My wife is a elementary school teacher and we always planned on having a child but timing it so she gave birth when she was nearing the end of the school year or during Summer vacation. I would really appreciate some advice on minimizing any financial burdens during my wife's maternity leave. I know a lot of you have probably already gone through this part of your life, so any advice that we can use would be greatly appreciated. We currently have savings but we would prefer to use it in better ways. My wife would also like to take the full 12 weeks that is allowed under FMLA, she does not like the idea of sending our newborn to daycare after only being 6 or 8 weeks old. We do not have a lot of family, and not sure if we would trust the family we do have to care after a newborn. All of our close friends also have full time jobs and would be unable to babysit.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the school offers short-term disability. After two weeks of my wife being on maternity leave they will pay her roughly $1,000.00 every two weeks. My wife has told me that short term disability will only cover up to 6 weeks unless there is an issue with the baby or my wife, then we would need a doctors authorization to provide to short-term disability. This means if there are no issues with the baby or pregnancy we will get roughly $2,000.00 from this. Once my wife returns to work we will also be impacted because the school will be taking extra money from her paycheck for health insurance that they were unable to take from her paycheck since she was on leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice on this would be greatly appreciated. We would be able to survive on my paycheck and our savings, but if there are ways to minimize the financial impact from my wife going on maternity leave we would surely like to find out and would be able to sleep easier.",Maternity Leave Finances,1

929,"I am what I call a superworrier. If something bothers me I get really worked up about it and imagine all kinds of scenarios that usually picture the worst to happen. Postpartum healing really had me. No one could give me a straight answer if they even wanted to talk about it. It seemed like a taboo subject of how you will feel post baby bump. But HELLO!! I‚Äôm pushing a baby out of me!! What‚Äôs going to happen afterwards? What if I tear? What if my belly doesn‚Äôt go back? What if I don‚Äôt heal right? What if I bleed forever? How do I prepare?

So I am now 8weeks PP and hope maybe talking about my experience and worries will help someone else on here not be as anxious. 

Tearing: I did tear when my baby was born. Yes, I did feel it. But I didn‚Äôt feel the pain. I just felt my skin separating if that makes sense. The pain was all focused on her crowing. After the birth when we were focusing on cleaning me up my midwife said I had three minor tears. Two by my urethra and one on my perineum. They were so minor she could glue them but that would really be unnecessary. It stung when I had to pee because of the two up there but aquaphor really calmed that down. I also had a peribottle filled with warm witch hazel and herb tea that I squirted while peeing and it really took away the cut of the stinging. They were healed in five days. Not bad at all. Honestly I think papercuts are worse. 

My belly: Now this is the biggest factor depending on age and size, I think. For reference I‚Äôm 22 and 5‚Äô 4‚Äù. I fluctuate between 135 and 140lbs depending on regular exercise or not. I got up to 161 during pregnancy. 

My belly all but went back to ‚Äúyou just look like you gained five pounds‚Äù in three days. And then slowly went down more. Now it just looks like I did some serious ab workouts and I‚Äôm swole. I could fit into some of my pre-preggo jeans in 4 weeks. Now there is only one pair that doesn‚Äôt fit me again. What people don‚Äôt tell you is your weight rearranges. All of my fat is not on my belly, it‚Äôs on my back. I never had back fat before but man, does it cut your self esteem. So just another friendly reminder to go easy on yourself. After all, you just popped another human being out of you. That‚Äôs pretty BA. 

Bleeding/lochia: My nurse said I could do absolutely nothing for two weeks and be done bleeding. Or go on with life and be done bleeding at six weeks. Well, being the active person I am and my husband still having to work, I had to get back to life two days after giving birth. I took it as slow as possible but I only stopped bleeding after 5 weeks. HOWEVER! This was not the ungodly gushing I thought was going to come out of my vagina. I seriously thought it would be the Nile river when Moses was preforming the plagues of Egypt and went and bought three bags of Depends. Nope. The first two days I filled one disposable panty modestly and after that used a thin, moderately absorbent, sports pad. It was easier to handle than most of my previous periods! Had no need to worry as much as I did. 

Sex: My husband and I gave it a go after six weeks. I was really dry so make sure you have some lube on you! My vagina felt more like itself than during the last month of pregnancy. It wasn‚Äôt the best, mind-blowing sex I‚Äôve had in my life but it was intimate and pleasurable. And after that we got to cuddle like normal again because I didn‚Äôt have a giant baby bump! Overall win. 

Healing in general: I can still feel my pelvic floor is loose. Do those kegels after birth too!! And my lower abs are still weaker than before. There‚Äôs an app called Matriarc for PP exercise that I‚Äôve been using and I really like it. But overall, postpartum physical healing has not been NEAR as bad as I thought it would be.

I have really crappy teeth. I went in for a cleaning and had two cavities that needed new fillings. I have a bridge in the front of my mouth which has been a source of anxiety for me. All of this is to say these simple cavities kind of gave me anxiety to get fixed. Normally, I'm not pregnant and I would take a prescribed Ativan and all is good. 

I Google obsessively if getting cavities filled is harmful to the baby, most of what I found indicated the meds they use are category B to numb you and how really its potentially worse to let dental care go while pregnant because of how quickly your teeth can get worse and the risk of infection which is harmful to the baby. 

My OB gave me the greenlight. I went yesterday, super anxious but it got done. BUT from the moment they numbed me up my baby was  moving non-stop! I'm 22w 6days today and am only now beginning to feel her and I never really felt her move and quick so s distinctly as I did while getting my cavities fixed. I mean the whole time she would move for like 30 secs stop and then do it all again.

I went in today at 37 weeks to submit the recent US results to my OB (I get my ultrasounds and lab work done out of the hospital so I have to forward them to her myself or bring them in to my appointments) and she seemed a bit concerned because she's always measured small. I, of course, was worried and asked her straight up if there was anything to worry about because I also haven't been gaining any weight (112 lbs since my last appointment, 2 weeks ago) and she said there was nothing to worry about. I even asked again if she meant that in a ""right now"" sense or if i shouldn't worry at all and she clarified that everything on the US reported to be normal and my placenta had a good amount of fluid and was aging well but my baby would just be considered ""constitutionally small"" which isn't a bad thing because I'm petite and if my baby was an 8 pounder, I'd need to get an ultrasound because my pelvis is a bit tiny. But since she ordered another ultrasound, I can't help but feel worried, she also said that she really needs to check if my baby is too small then it might be reason to be induced.

Well, guess I'm in the odd 5% because everything happened so fast I didn't even have time to think about it!

&amp;#x200B;

From 36w on, every appointment I had my doctor said the same thing: the baby is already very low but no dilation at all. I was already at 40+2 and had no bloody show, seen no mucus plug and didn't feel anything remotely close to real contractions (only the Braxton-Hicks I've been having for the past month). So last Sunday I went to bed feeling the baby kicking as usual, nothing was out of order. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up suddenly at 4 am and right after I opened my eyes I felt a super strong kick and then my water broke in a huge splash all over the bed. Immediately after that I felt the first contraction and though hell yes, they were right when they said you can't mistake them for anything else. Still, I thought we had some time. I woke up my husband and we started getting ready, and then another contraction came, 5 min after the first one. I got more anxious and told him maybe we should hurry a bit. Another one came in 5 min so we really picked up the pace; by the time we were in the car and on our way to the hospital, they were already 4 minutes apart and getting stronger. When we got to the ER at 5.30, I could barely stand and they admitted me immediately. They checked and I was already 7 cm dilated. I couldn't believe it. It was happening so fast I couldn't even use any of the active positions or exercises I learnt at my pregnancy class. The midwives were super nice and encouraging, and they also commented on how fast I was going. The only bummer was that I didn't get epidural, because they said I was already too far in. So about 15 minutes after I was admitted, the pushing came and sadly that's where things slow down a bit. I remember reading about women that gave birth after 3 or 4 pushes... I wasn't that lucy, maybe my body used all its energy on the super fast dilation. Anyway, I was pushing for two hours and it was so freaking painful I couldn't even think straight. I was screaming at the top of my lungs. I was holding my husband's hand and later he showed me how badly I scratched it. I started to feel real helpless when the midwife said I was slowing down and suggested an oxytocin drip. I was torn apart because I wanted to finish as soon as possible, but didn't know if I could stand the contractions more painful and frequent that I already had. I decided to go for it and maybe 15 minutes after they hooked me up, little Jacob was born! And I have to say it's true what I heard, the second they put him in my arms and I saw his little face, all the pain just disappeared and I was beaming, smiling, laughing and joking with the midwives. 

&amp;#x200B;

It all took 4 hours and a half, from when I woke up in my bed until I was holding my baby. Everyone commented on how lucky I was to have such a fast and smooth delivery, and honestly I'm thankful for that, but also - knowing how painful it was - I simply cannot imagine surviving this for a longer time, and still don't understand how strong other women must be to be in labor for 10 hours or more. I felt I was already at the end of my pain tolerance and energy levels after mine, and it seems surreal to think it could take three or four times longer than this. Anyway, my son is here and he's perfect, and it's all that matters :)

958,"So I hadn't encountered this possibility in my quest for unmedicated child birth: the fact that my little stinker could go breech in. her. LAST. FRIGGIN. WEEK! Who does that?  Where did she find the room?  Is she going to be some kind of mole rat gymnast when she gets out? What is this?

She's basically been head down since 36 weeks and I had my perfect birth plan cycling through my mind- with one caveat, baby and mom come out safe no matter what.  Be open to different experiences. So here I am. Being SUPER open minded.  

My midwives brought our OB in yesterday when I came in with what I thought was leaking fluid... (nope, just peeing myself, baby's breeched butt just pressing super hard on my bladder) They had me do an ultra sound and found her in frank breech. This, along with pitted edema,  high blood pressure, and a headache,  put my swollen ass on a fun way ride straight to L&amp;D for a few hours of tests.  Good news: baby is a happy camper, I'm really healthy, and this won't be an emergency.  Not my favorite news: the attempt for unmedicated is shot out the window.

But like I said,  open minded is best.  AND my team has the mindset of least intervention possible,  which is why I'm with them, and why we will give it a go and try to turn her.  I love my midwives and doc. Go team!

The plan now goes like this:
Start with epidural.  Try and turn baby.  If baby DOES turn,  go on with pitocin, don't give her a chance to turn back around, attempt vaginal birth.  If baby DOES NOT turn,  its a planned c-section, we're already in the O.R., I'll have a guaranteed baby TODAY! 

Either way it's happy birthday baby.  So I'm celebrating with my last meal before 5am and then my fasting begins.  I'm having 1/2 a twice baked potato,  two fried eggs,  spinach salad,  and a small blueberry parfait.  I'm going all out as I feel this is really the last decision I get to make all on my own today-  or from now on really.  

Wish me luck ladies.  We're going in.  ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°

962,"Got my first real contraction at 3am yesterday. Been non-stop contracting and losing mucus plug since. 

But no matter how bad they get, nor how close together, I haven't hit the magic 5-1-1 yet to go in! I've bounced, walked, showered, took a bath, sat reverse-cowgirl on the toilet, rocked in a rocking chair, done every yoga pose I'm still able to do (go fuck yourself, warrior 3). 

The doctor's office offered to let me come in for a shot of morphine - but due to a family history of opiate addiction, I'd rather not. That said, I'd totally recommend it to anyone without that genetic baggage!

I got a few hours of sleep, mostly sitting straight up, and zoning out to Season 3 of The Office on repeat. My game plan now that the sun is back up is to drink coffee and just walk around outside in the fresh air, trying to get up to the goddamned stupid motherfucking 5-1-1 frequency.

964,"Background:

As the title suggests, my partner and I got the news that she is 4 weeks pregnant over the weekend. While I'm excited, I've also never been more terrified as I have no idea how to approach caring for a child, although I'm 100% committed to being there for her and couldn't look myself in the mirror if I felt otherwise. I'm afraid I may have to drop out of my university course in order to help pay for and care for our child, as my partner also studies full time and enjoys her course a lot more than me (on top of which I would never ask her to put her dreams on hold for anything if it can be helped) and I'm also afraid of the financial implications of having a child. I'm admittedly not amazing with money and I think I can be quite impulsive, but I'm hoping some time and solid advice from family can help me change that mindset. 

Finally, I've suffered from pretty bad anxiety and depression bouts for the past 5 or 6 years, and I'm super afraid that this will have an impact on my child and my partner. I want to be there and I want to be the best person I can be for both of them so I plan on seeking help for this once again so as to be as stable as I can for our child's arrival. I'm hoping that somebody in this forum has faced the same problems as me before and can give me some good pointers on how to be the best partner and father possible in the months and years ahead.

My uncle then commented ""A bit disrespectful &amp; abrasive to your family, ____. You‚Äôve forgotten that most of your family have experience raising children.  I think we know better"". I lost it and had an anxiety attack. I've been struggling with antenatal depression, worries over being a new mom, and knowing that my husband is leaving shortly after her birth for 7 months. 

Some people messaged me after seeing the comment and reassured me that I am doing the best for my daughter. I doubled down in my stance and replied ""I am sorry you feel disrespected over my boundaries regarding my child"". I then decided to be ""selfish"" and it just be immediate family for the first month of her life. Everyone else can wait on MY terms because I'm tired of giving in to be polite.

Anyone else deal with something similar?

997,"I never post and only lurk and find this a super supportive community so decided to finally post.

As a FTM at 34 weeks with a very complex medical history  I am now seeing a different medical professional daily, my medical team is made up of many consultants of different specialities to keep an eye on everything. Its pretty exhausting and expensive, however I am so happy the baby is doing great.

My husband is super supportive and has been my rock. My family on the other hand has not supported me at all, I don't expect anything but they have a special way of letting me down. For example mother has found a stroller in a dumpster which she rescued for me, its very broken, rusty, ripped, unsanitary and belongs in the dumpster. She keeps telling my extended family how she ""got me a pram"" as she purchased new ones for my nephew and niece. I have said nothing and purchased my own.

Today I met my family for dinner where they told me how selfish I am for wanting to have a child, my medical condition is not hereditary and I am able to work and care for this child. My sister who is a nurse then went on to say ""you are probably going to have a still born child so you better be prepared for that!"" I was ready to cry however I just smiled and continued my meal. I secretly wanted every one to stand up for me but no one did, they agreed with her.

The only reason I stay in contact with them is the hope they will someday care and treat me like they treat each other but after today I have realised my husband is the only person I care about. Sorry for the rant and thank you for listening x

I don‚Äôt feel as if my regular obgyn is informative or even compassionate towards me. This is my first pregnancy and I had literally no idea how anything is suppose to be and she treats me as if I should know. (I‚Äôm on insurance where it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to switch doctors. But we will be moving shortly after baby is born so I will have to get a new doctor.) 

Just for reference, she didn‚Äôt know why I was having pains/bleeding around 18 weeks and just dismissed it as growing pains. But I knew something else was wrong in my gut, so I went to the ER and they quickly found out it was placenta previa. 

Forwarding back to last week, I had this increasing very painful and sharp episodes lasting around 20 or seconds every 5-10 mins. I figured they‚Äôd resolve themselves if I just rested and slept well that night. Pain did not resolve and actually got much worse to where I was crying and screaming in pain each time those pains would arrive. I called my doctor after 24 of first noticing the pain, I got seen and baby‚Äôs heart was monitored. She dismissed it as just growing pains and to take Tylenol. The pain was so bad it was hard to walk, sit, lay, and even breathe. I‚Äôve been in pain ever since then and it‚Äôs hard to still do any daily activity. 

This morning it got much worse again and keeps happening. Idk if this is actually growing pains but I don‚Äôt feel as if the pains should be consistently hitting me on a schedule timing and nothing can cure/stop the pain.

Everyone has an idea in their head of how they want their birth experience to go, and I personally was hoping for a kinda crunchy, lower-intervention experience. For labor to start naturally, not needing drugs to kickstart it, etc. At our appt today at 39+1, our doctor told me I have ""the strongest cervix I've ever seen!"" and that baby girl will most likely not come out on her own before the 41 week deadline (the longest this practice will let a pregnancy go without intervention).

1002,"Hello fellow expecting folks,

I just found out I was pregnant on Monday with a very faint line on a test at 10dpo. This was completely unplanned and I had been on the pill as my s/o and I are still in our early twenties and weren't necessarily planning on kids until our thirties. But, here we are! I'm not mad at it and neither is my baby's father. He is quite excited and that has made all of my emotions feel a little easier.

My problem is that I am driving myself crazy. Before around a week ago when I started to feel a little funny, I never thought seriously about being pregnant or how to prepare myself for that. I've always wanted children but now I'm here and I'm petrified by everything. I was a heavy cigarette smoker before pregnancy which I have now quit cold turkey (weirdly enough it's not been terribly difficult because they make me really sick now!) But I'm horrified that there are certainly still traces of all that crap in my body. I also have been in recovery from anorexia since just March of 2018. I wasn't even sure I could get pregnant anymore with how damaging my last relapse was and only just became weight restored a few months ago, and now I'm petrified that my body is somehow unfit for this pregnancy because of my eating disorder. I just got back to the point where I recognize my own face again, how could my body possibly be healthy enough to carry this child?!

I have an intuition that my baby will be okay, but I'm still so desperately anxious and I can't stop googling everything. I've taken more tests and they're all still faint which is making me scared as I'm now 12 dpo and the lines should have probably darkened by now...but I know that peeing on a stick is no science and I'm likely driving myself up a wall with no purpose! My boyfriend had to drag me out of the bathroom yesterday because I was just sitting there staring at all my tests and crying because I'm terrified to lose the baby. And then I spotted a tiny bit this morning, just a tad of brown and I'm at peak panic feelings.

Worse, I know that a doctor probably won't see me until 8-10 weeks and it feels impossible to wait that long! How did you all do it? How are you still doing it? I've been officially pregnant for two days and I think I'm losing my mind!",FTM at four weeks and totally in silent panic mode,1

1019,"After three weeks of bed rest due to blood pressure issues, I was scheduled to be induced on 11/27 at 38 weeks along. As fearful as I was about the induction, my husband and I took the last day as DINK's to enjoy a steak dinner before heading to the hospital. When we arrived, my OB warned me that it was going to be a long process but that my little one should arrive by the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

To begin the induction, I had cervidil inserted for 12 hours. They told me to get as much rest as possible throughout the night, so I would be ready when labor began the next day. This was almost laughable since I was hooked up to a blood pressure cuff that went off every hour on the hour. My husband and I were able to get some broken hours of sleep until 6 am the next day. The nurse woke us up, gave me the chance to shower, but warned me that the shower leaks into the room so don't run it longer than 10 minutes. By this point, I was feeling some mild cramps and was about 2 cm dilated. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 8 am, they started a pitocin drip to help move the process along. I was really concerned that with the increased contractions my blood pressure would raise, but it stayed under 120/80. By 10 am, my OB came to check on me and see if I had progressed, but I was still at 2 cm. She decided to break my water to get things moving. This was one of my biggest fears, because I had friends who told me how painful contractions were after having their water broke. It is really a weird experience for a FTM. I didn't realize ""breaking your water"" meant leaking everywhere for hours on end. Thankfully, the contractions weren't much worse than before and I was able to still walk around and use the labor ball to help make it through them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was continuing to receive higher dosages of pitocin to make my contractions stronger and more consistent. By 6 pm, my OB did another check to discover I was still at 2 cm. At this point, I wasn't in much pain but exhausted and upset to know that I didn't progress all day. I went to the bathroom while she was finishing up some notes with the nurse. When I came out, my husband asked if I wanted a chicken quesadilla. I laughed and said yes but was annoyed at the joke. My OB replied that it wasn't a joke and that she was going to let me eat dinner since this still could be a long haul. After not eating for more than 24 hours, you should have seen the smile on my face! 

&amp;#x200B;

By 9 pm, I felt another pop and it felt like the rest of my water broke. This is when my contractions started to get extremely painful. I called the nurse to get an epidural, and as luck would have it, the anesthesiologist had just gone into a c-section, so he wouldn't be available for another hour. This was one of the longest hours. I went into a cycle of going to the bathroom, walking around the room, bouncing on the labor ball, and getting back rubs from my husband. I was beyond ready for the epidural when the anesthesiologist arrived. My husband was asked to leave the room for the procedure, but the nurse stayed with me and held my hands as I was going through contractions while trying to keep still. It only took about fifteen minutes to feel complete relief.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been hopeful that the epidural would give me a chance to rest and boy was I wrong. About a half hour later, my blood pressure crashed from the epidural and went below 90/50. The anesthesiologist was called back to give me a shot of adrenaline. At the same time, I was given an oxygen mask because the baby's heart rate was dropping with each contraction. They had to put a monitor directly on the baby, which was difficult since I was still only 2 cm dilated. There was a rush of nurses coming in and out of the room keeping a close eye on my blood pressure and the baby's heart rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

By midnight, the nurse started me on antibiotics to prevent infections since it had been so long since my water was broken. At this point, I asked the nurse if by morning, I could just get a c-section. I had two friends who were induced and went longer than 24 hours. Both of their doctors recommended a c-section, so I thought that was normal procedure. The nurse said that my doctor ordered at least 3 more doses of antibiotics at six hour intervals, so it'll be some time before we need to progress to a c-section. My mood severely dropped and the only thing that kept me going was my husband's support. 

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, my OB gave me a break from the pitocin so I could get some rest and give the baby a break from contractions. I went to sleep immediately and woke up at 5:30 am to three nurses hovering above me, telling me to put the oxygen mask back on. I thought great, what more can go wrong. After another cervix check, the nurse said that the head was crowning and not to push until my doctor arrives. My husband and I were over the moon!! 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband queued up the delivery playlist and helped me ""blow out the candles"" to keep from pushing during contractions. After a long and frustrating labor, I have to say delivery was the easiest part! My OB arrived and she had me start pushing. Even with epidural, I was able to feel myself pushing but there was no pain. It only took four contractions and my little one arrived. The best feeling in the world was feeling the warmth from my newborn daughter on my chest afterward.  Here's my baby tax: [https://imgur.com/a/tREF31r](https://imgur.com/a/tREF31r)

&amp;#x200B;

Before going through labor and deliver, I had taken pre-natal yoga classes and a lamaze course, since I thought I would try to give birth without any medical interventions. After the blood pressure scare, I knew that I was going to have to accept the interventions, because they were what was best for my health and my little one's safety. I didn't realize that I would be literally having almost every medical intervention necessary. However, looking back on it, I'm thankful that my little one and I are safe and healthy, and we were able to recover so quickly. It has been a little over two weeks, and I'm feeling great. Most of my bleeding has stopped, I've been able to walk 3-4 miles a day, and my blood pressure is back to normal. Those interventions saved me from worse complications. 

&amp;#x200B;

One last note, new mom's take care of yourselves and your health. This is the best gift you can give your little one. I struggled with breastfeeding and ended up switching after a week to a combination of pumped milk and formula. It made me feel so guilty, but my husband was able to help with feedings and I was able to get some necessary rest. It has helped strengthen my bond with my daughter and she has gained back her birth weight and more with the mixture! My biggest suggestion is don't google anything. Trust your instincts, your doctor, and pediatrician. They will help make sure you are doing what's best for you and your family.  ","Birth Story: FTM, Induction, Chaotic Neutral",1

1034,"Hi baby bumps 

I just received a call from my midwife about my 20 week ultrasound which was this past Friday. She said that according to the report there is amniotic sludge / debris present. She said she has no experience with this, and has never heard of this (she has been practicing for 30 odd years??) As a result she is sending a consult to a few OBs in town to get their opinions on the situation. According to her this is a sign of possible preterm labour. 
It should be noted that the ultrasound I had on Friday was HORRIBLE. The tech was inexperienced and in training. The baby wasn't cooperating for some of the measurements required and as a result she started pounding on my stomach was the ultrasound instrument trying to get baby to move. She became aggitated and asked that I go for a walk to see if the baby would move positions. He did not. So she pounded again and used both hands to force the took down as far as it would  go into my abdomen, as a result I had bruises the next day.

Not sure how to feel right now and I just need to get it all out.

Got my BFP on 12/7. Had some brown spotting on 12/8 and didn't get too concerned. Cue one episode of wiping with scant bright red blood. I tried not to freak out but deep inside resigned myself that this was it. I was going to lose this pregnancy. Then everything stopped later that night and I decided to see what happened. Everything was smooth sailing from there with constipation, bloating, aversions- all the ""good"" signs of pregnancy. 

The yesterday at 4 weeks 6 days I had some tiny red spotting again with light cramping. I decided this time to call the OB, but couldn't get in to the hospital for labs because I work a over an hour away. So we decided this morning is fine and to call if anything changed. Spotting turned brown and stopped last evening so I felt some relief but still had that nagging in the back of my mind. 

This morning the spotting had returned red but very light with some light cramping. As I was driving to the hospital the cramps got worse and I just knew I was bleeding more. And I was. Full on moderate period flow. 

After the labs I drove over an hour to work kind of zoned out. I honestly do not know how I feel. I was kind of just... waiting for it. Then I feel terrible for not feeling worse. Then I talk to my husband and my eyes well, but no crying. I'm kind of numb. 

I did call the OB back this morning and they're trying to get my labs back but still waiting. I was ordered to go back Thursday as well to see if it increases but I wonder if there is any point. 

I know there are people out there that bleed and go on to have successful pregnancies but I'm not hopeful. Then I feel bad about that. Like I'm giving up. 

I got pregnant on the first try with my son but  have had nothing but problems since April this year. My mind is racing with all these thoughts like "" What is wrong with me that I am having so much trouble? Was is the femara? do I have something else wrong with me? Will I ever have more kids?""

This is my first time posting and if all goes well I should be a FTM in June 2019.  I was told this was a wonderful support group and I am in dire need of support right now.

I am 14 weeks in, hyperemesis started at 4 weeks in and gradually got worse. I've gone through my previous 16 pills a day prescription to lower my vomitting to 3 or 4 times a day, and my doctor is taking so much time re-submitting the prescription to my pharmacy that I am now full blown vomiting all over again and can't keep anything down.  
I guess my patience is wearing super thin, I am very tired, I am cold all the time, I can't sleep because nausea is the kind of symptom that keeps you awake even when you're exhausted. I feel so weak and like a bad mom. Sometimes the thought of giving up goes through my mind. My SO is wonderful btw, he doesn't fully get it but he's extremely supportive nonetheless, he's just not here right now and I'm having a breakdown. 

I need to hear from people who have had this. How strong do you have to be to pull through this? All I have doesn't seem likes it's enough. Did the pills hurt your baby in any way?

**TLDR**

I had my first contraction ever around 1pm when I was 36+6, and had a baby at 8:54pm. I had an epidural, and with very strong contractions and effective pushing for only 30 minutes, labor was easy for me. I pooped, peed, and threw up, then gave birth to a mostly healthy baby girl. She was jaundiced and spent some time in the NICU but we're all doing well now. 

---
**Conception and Pregnancy** 

I was really lucky, we decided to try and have a baby in early March, then my period never came in April. I was very healthy and active throughout pregnancy and didn't have any complications. My doctor said that I was making it look easy.

Wednesday 11/14 my doctor checked my cervix and it was at 1cm already, but apparently that doesn't mean anything. I was more tired than normal in the week before. I did have sex over the weekend, and regularly eat spicy foods. 

---
**How the big day started** 

On Monday, 11/19, I was 36+6. Woke up at 11am not hungry, and slightly nauseous (very out of the ordinary for me). 

I felt like I was leaking fluid, but little came out when I went to the toilet. It smelled like urine to me, and there wasn't much. Again, I hadn't been having bladder leaks at all, but I just thought ‚ÄúOh so I guess bladder leaks are happening now.‚Äù

I was also feeling constipated and pressure from the belly button down, no contractions, it was a constant feeling. I thought I was just bound up, just having a bad day. Again, this is normal for pregnant women in general, but wasn't for me. I had almost no stomach discomfort the whole pregnancy. I did get hungry and manage to eat a small breakfast at 12pm. 

---
**Labor signs** 

Some time between 1:00 and 1:30pm I started to think I was feeling contractions. These were basically the first time I had ever had contractions in my entire life. Anything I felt before that, I was never really positive if it was a contraction or kicks or gas. It was an uncomfortable tightening feeling all through my midsection. I started timing a about 1:30pm. 

For the hour and a half that I was timing them, the frequency was usually around 4-6 minutes apart, as many as 10 and as little as 3 a couple times. They lasted 30-60 seconds. Sometimes they felt like slight discomfort, and there were a few that made my face flush and nearly throw up.  In the beginning, I tried moving around and stretching a little, but quickly found that I was more comfortable on the couch with my heated blanket and snuggly cat. 

---
**Getting monitored at the clinic**

I called doctor at 2:45pm. Thinking that it would all go away on its own by the time I got there and I would feel silly, I called a friend for a ride just in case. Got in at 3:30pm and went on monitors for a little bit to track my contractions and baby's heart rate. The doctor checked my cervix and it was at 3cm. We talked about whether my water had broken, I said I was doubtful it had, but she said it felt broken to her, so she did the test and it turns out my water was broken! We don't really know when it broke, but the estimate they went with was 11am. I wish I could have seen the look on my face when she said, ‚ÄúSo you're having a baby today.‚Äù 

I called my husband as I getting dressed. He was already done at work so he was on his way home, and he got pulled over! Not because he was speeding, I guess he didn't slow down when he passed by a cop car who had pulled someone else over? The cop let him off with a warning, fortunately! Then I sent a quick message to my dad, and the friend that gave me a ride.  DH called my in-laws.  We didn‚Äôt really want the world to know outside of that.  Once I had my several layers of clothes and my coat back on, the nurse took me over to the hospital in a wheelchair and helped me get checked in.  She seemed happy when they told her which room to take me to.  I got a really good one. 

The nurses didn't feel the need to help me breathe through contractions, I was doing it well on my own, and I didn't use any of the the breathing exercises we went over in the birthing class. I just did what worked.  They asked me to rank my pain on that silly 1-10 scale.  I never know how to answer that question.  Pain is relative and memories of pain are unreliable.  I was sure that I was in much less pain than my dad was when he blew his hand up with a firework many years ago, but more than if I had stubbed my toe.  Before she could whip out the laminated paper with the color-coded smiley/frowny faces on it, I called it a 6.83 just to make the nurse happy.  She got a chuckle out of that, and decided to round it down to a 6 since I was still in such good spirits.  I also threw up twice by the time the doctor got to me. 

---
**Epidural**

The doctor came to see me around 5:00pm and we talked about pain management, among other things. When I had thought about this before, what I expected to happen was that I would want to move around and stretch to get through contractions until I decided it was too much and wanted rest, only then would I get the epidural. I also figured I wasn't very far along at this point, because labor doesn't usually go that fast in all the stories I've read!  It turned out I had no interest in moving around, I felt better just resting and relaxing in the bed while my husband talked to me and kept making me smile.  I decided to just go ahead and ask for an epidural. It was getting pretty uncomfortable and I knew that it could take 45 minutes to an hour for the anesthesiologist to get to me. 

The anesthesiologist got there at about 7pm. Having it inserted wasn't bad at all, didn‚Äôt hurt more than any other injection.  After about 20 minutes, I couldn't feel my contractions anymore. The epidural took away the pain, but I still had a lot of control of my legs. I could push my hips up off the bed a little. I could straighten and reach my legs off the sides of the bed. I could wiggle my toes. I also still had some feeling in my legs, I didn't feel like they were ‚Äúgone‚Äù or anything. 

Once it kicked in, I was really relaxed and felt really good. The nurse told me my contractions were looking very strong. The plan was to labor down for a while, and the doctor would come and check me soon. 

---
**Things started progressing quickly**

We waited around for about a half hour.  Then I told the nurses I was feeling a lot of pressure in my lower tummy and rectally, like I really needed a giant poop. I also started getting shaky in waves, sometimes making my teeth chatter. When I told them this, Their eyebrows hit the ceiling so the nurse decided to check my cervix. She said about 9.5 cm and I would be pushing soon. We were all so surprised! 

They hadn't even gotten around to putting in the catheter yet, so they decided to do a quicker type of catheter just to empty my bladder, instead of the one they would normally use which gets left in. I‚Äôve never had a catheter before so I had been nervous about this, but I didn‚Äôt feel anything at all.  She just fed it in, let my pee drain into a container, and then took it out.

I laid there for a little while, feeling that pressure come and go with my contractions. This part of the experience was actually really pleasurable. My body must have been pumping me with a lot of endorphins. It just felt right, it felt exciting and soothing. I've heard labor described as feeling like an ‚Äúout of body‚Äù experience, and that wasn't how I felt at all. I felt really connected and in tune with my body. 

---
**Push!**

Soon, the doctor came and it was time to start pushing. The nurse held one leg up for me and my husband held the other. I could still feel the pressure, but not pain, of the contractions, so I knew when it was time to push. The nurse was watching the monitors to help me time the pushes, but I knew it was coming before she did so we had it pretty coordinated. The nurse would count to ten as I pushed, I would take a quick breath, and then we would go again, three times per contraction. Nobody told me ‚Äúhow‚Äù to push, it was kind of like pooping. In fact, I did poop, which was actually one of the things I was most afraid of going into this, but at the time I didn't care. Anyways, I decided I wanted to see what was going on, so I asked for a mirror. It made my pushing even more efficient because then I could see the bits down there separating as my baby made her way out. Once I saw her head, I kept pushing with renewed vigor, sometimes doing four pushes per contraction instead of three. They were pretty much back to back anyway. 

After just 29 minutes of pushing, there she was. With help from the doctor, my husband caught her as she slid out. It made a really juicy sound and fluids spewed everywhere. They put her on my chest and I held her skin to skin as they pushed on my stomach to help the placenta come out. I still felt like I could push to help it come out and asked if she wanted me to. So she had me push a few times, and then I peed everywhere. Oops! 

Eventually the placenta came out. I don't think I felt it come out at all. It looked like a bloody slab of liver meat. Pretty cool. They delayed clamping the cord, and had my husband cut it when it was time. 

She did latch on and breastfeed within the first hour, but it was a struggle after that. 

Myra Jane was born at 8:54 pm, and six pounds eight ounces, 19.5 inches long, and with brown hair. Later, a nurse told me that based on the timing, I was probably 7 or 8 cm dilated by the time I actually got the epidural, so I probably could have gone without. Maybe, but I don't really have an interest in finding out. I enjoyed the experience and would make all the same choices if I had to do it over. All births are natural! 

---
**Recovering from the epidural**
 
Once things were all settled down, it was time for me to get out of bed and try to go to the bathroom. Although I could move my legs around in bed, standing and walking was a totally different story. With support from two nurses, I locked my knees and penguin shuffled my way to the bathroom, booty shaking the whole way, it was hilarious! I kind of ‚Äúdidn't know how‚Äù to go to the bathroom at first, which was weird, but the plumbing was all working again and I was able to walk within a couple hours. 

---
**The first few weeks**
 
So that's the story of the birth of my baby. Unfortunately, she was jaundiced, so we went into the NICU on day 2 and were there until the following Saturday, in and out of phototherapy and struggling to keep her fed. She breastfed a couple of times in the first two days but quickly got weaker until she couldn't latch at all (jaundice made her lethargic and not eating worsened her jaundice). I pumped like crazy and we used a few different tools (syringe with a tiny tube on a fingertip, bottles, nipple shields) but we've got it now. Getting to where she could latch on, stay latched, and suck vigorously for long enough to get adequately fed has been an adventure and there were times I wanted to quit, but I had good support from lactation consultants and now I'm glad I didn't. 

She's a pretty chill, predictable baby. She fusses whenever she needs something but rarely cries, she loves bath time, and is really good at getting her hands free from her swaddle.

---
**The motherly bond**

The moment she was placed in my arms was magical, and my husband says he wishes he had a picture of that moment. But from there, the bond wasn't totally automatic.

I probably had baby blues for a bit but I feel better now.  Even though there were some negative feelings, there is nothing like quiet snuggles, carrying her around in my offbrand Moby, the warm fuzzy feeling that I get from breastfeeding, seeing her fall asleep so contently after a successful feed from nothing but a bare nipple after all that hard work, seeing my husband love on her‚Ä¶ I want what's best for her and I want her to have the best care I can give her, but we‚Äôre led to believe we‚Äôre supposed to be gushing with magical motherly right from the get-go; reality just isn‚Äôt that simple.

I don't post on fb much but I did announce my pregnancy there so she knows I'm expecting (I'm 25 weeks and if you know me I'm obviously showing). Anyway, when we were done hugging she gave my belly a really nice hug and my daughter squirmed happily away in there and everything in that moment felt really content and nice.

It was the first time someone touched my belly and it made me feel really good. Maybe it's because I'm doing this solo or maybe because her intentions were genuine and sweet but I didn't mind a bit.

This is my first post here, but given how big this community, I‚Äôm hoping for an advise. 
I‚Äôm starting new job in 3 weeks when I‚Äôll be 16 weeks pregnant. My new line manager does not know yet, as I signed contract when it was too early to disclose. So couple of questions here: 
1) any tips on how to tell him and what things to stress out? I was thinking about telling him that a) I‚Äôm ok travelling next 3 months (as it will be necessary) and after baby is born, as my husband is supporting here, b) that I will take only 3 months off, as we have short maternity leave there, so he is not losing me for a long time. Anything else worth telling? 
2) Any tips from people who are further ahead on how to plan and structure work? Right now I would like to schedule majority of travel in the next 3 months and then only go somewhere by train and when completely necessary. 
3) Any tips/advice on returning to work and how to organise that?

1063,"So with my first pregnancy I had pre-eclampsia that started around my 36th week. Luckily, it never got terribly bad. Somehow by the fates, I went into labor the night before I was scheduled to be induced and labor and delivery went smoothly. I delivered a little past 37 weeks, and I truly believe the pre-eclampsia stunted her growth because she barely came out 5 pounds.  She's 18 months now and we plan to start ttc when she turns 2ish. Research says that pre-eclampsia is a first pregnancy thing and I don't have a high percentage of getting it again, but looking at other forums tells me otherwise.

I've been working for the same company for a long time, and I'm long overdue to get a promotion. I also really have to focus on my career, as my partner is going to be a stay-at-home parent after our child is born. I'm about 4 months pregnant, and I've applied for a promotion at work. I expected to have the interviews this month, though, I just found out today that the posting has been pulled, will be re-issued next month and everyone can re-apply then. Which means that I will be 5 or 6 or even 7 months pregnant by the time the interviews happen, and my plan of wearing my pre-pregnancy interview clothes is now out the window. We also can have up to 4 interviews, and while everyone in the company wears casual clothes for day-to-day we're expected to dress professional for the interviews. Which means 4 new professional outfits that I will wear exactly once. Also, while my manager has assured me that they will not take into account my pregnancy and the fact that I will be out for three months shortly after starting, that's a lot easier to believe when they can't tell during the interview.

So, I'm pretty pissed about this sudden change. Any suggestions? One of my coworkers suggested I go to HR, but I'm not sure what they're going to do. Demand that my interviews suddenly happen tomorrow? I'm not sure if that would work out great if they could.

Edited for [baby tax](https://imgur.com/a/9Dkriu6) 

We got to the hospital at 3:30 on Sunday to start our induction due to high blood pressure. As soon as I got in I was told to pee in a cup and put on the dreaded labor gown. I thought I might escape being immediately half naked but no such luck. They had to hook me up to all the monitors and a blood pressure cuff. I also had to have an IV placed which made me nauseous and shaky. They had to try a couple of times and collapsed a vein in the process. I told my husband to sit as he began looking extremely pale. 

The nurse was very nice. She asked if I had a birth plan and I told her my only plan was for me and baby to be healthy and if possible to avoid narcotics as they make me EXTREMELY LOOPY. Claritin D makes me hallucinate so I really didn‚Äôt think I could have anything stronger. She laughed and wrote it down. She was also careful to take every latex product out of the room as I‚Äôm allergic and she didn‚Äôt want anyone accidentally using them. The doctor eventually came in, checked me, and said I was ‚Äúat a good 1cm.‚Äù He then inserted the cytotec pill and said they would give the pills orally every four hours and see how I was doing in the morning. 

My mom and aunt came by, brought us dinner and tried to make the time pass quickly. My mom was also a bro and grabbed me a milkshake right at 11 before I got cut off from food at midnight. Sleeping was absolutely miserable. I kept having to pee which meant my husband would get up every few minutes, unplug all  the monitors, I‚Äôd use the bathroom, then waddle back and have to be hooked back up. The nurses came in about every 45 minutes to get Leo back on the monitor as he kept wiggling away from it. They remarked that they could clearly feel him wiggle and move but has more trouble than usual keeping him on the monitors. 

By the morning I felt like absolute crap due to lack of sleep and being stuck in uncomfortable positions . They let me take a shower which I gladly accepted to wash all the monitor jelly off of my tummy. Much to my delight my doctor also let me eat breakfast. My aunt ran out and grabbed me Chick-fil-A since I despise hospital food. Afterwards I tried to nap on and off, mostly unsuccessfully. By the fourth or fifth round of cytotec the doctor felt that breaking my waters would not only help with progression but would allow them to place an internal contraction monitor since the other monitor wasn‚Äôt working well. He wanted to have a better idea of my contractions before he started the pitocin. The actual breaking of the waters didn‚Äôt hurt at all although he apologized profusely through it. I told him that I was far more traumatized by the IV than cervical check or anything. 

After that my contractions really ramped up. The pitocin was started at this point as well.  I was handling them just fine until back labor set in. I went from gladly talking through contractions to having to breathe through them and demanding my husband to rub my back. The nurse said it could take as long as an hour from the time I decided on an epidural for them to get there so I said ‚ÄúYEP IM READY.‚Äù She wanted to know if I was sure because I had been taking it so well until the last fifteen minutes or so. The answer was a shameless yes. I told her I was pretty sure that he was face up based on that back labor but nothing came of my suggestion. (I actually mentioned this to several more people over the course of the day but no one paid it any mind.) The anesthesiologist was in within 20 minutes and I‚Äôve never been more relieved to see someone. Everyone but my husband got kicked out while they performed the procedure. Luckily the contractions I got through it were fairly bearable.
I know epidurals aren‚Äôt supposed to make you high but I swear I felt a little high as it started to take affect. My mom and aunt were let back in the room and they agreed that I looked out of it. Luckily this allowed me to actually get some sleep despite being soaked in amniotic fluid and hooked up to awkward machines. Unluckily my blood pressure got too LOW every time I got into a deep sleep. I was able to get just enough sleep I didn‚Äôt feel quite so dead before giving up because I kept setting off alarms. I got to sit up for a while and do some crosswords. It was nice after being stuck on my back for so long. 

At the next check I was 4cm! Unfortunately Leo started having heart decelerations with the contractions. I got put on my side again and given oxygen. They watched him closely for a few minutes but the decelerations didn‚Äôt stop. They turned off the pitocin for a while and he seemed to respond well. I still contracted fairly consistently. The nurse warned me that she did see these kinds of situations turn into emergency c-sections. She felt this was even more likely considering my husband and I were both 9lbs and emergency deliveries. 

Once they deemed him stable they turned the pitocin back on. He did well this time so I continued to labor on. This is the period of time that seemed to drag on for forever. We listened to some music.  My husband kept rolling his chair around the room like a psycho instead standing up which made me laugh so hard I was snorting. Mostly we were all bored out if our minds. About the time my aunt was going to run get them dinner I was checked and told I was 7cms. She was afraid to leave so instead grabbed them some vending machine snacks.

7cm to 10cm seemed to go pretty quickly. It was about 6pm when I was told I could start some practice pushes. The doctor was there for them incase I progressed really quickly. I got frustrated with pushing almost immediately. I couldn‚Äôt feel where to push very well through the epidural. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt hold my breath to the count of 10, take a quick breath and keep going. I was having to take a quick breath in the middle of pushing which the nurses told me not to do. I told them I couldn‚Äôt breathe so I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly how to fix that. (I think I phrased it more kindly but I was super overtired at that point soooo ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.) My main nurse at the time grabbed me the oxygen and that helped some. The doctor kept saying that he felt I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt really going for it‚Äù and to ‚Äútry harder.‚Äù I‚Äôm a perfectionist and extremely athletic. Every time he said these things I wanted nothing more than to beat the crap out of him. I was also starting to get really upset because I felt I should have been automatically good at pushing. 

After a while of unproductive pushing the doctor had to go work with some of the other patients. (Three of us were in labor at once and he was the only doctor there.) I had anywhere from two to eight nurses at one time working with me. We did the tug of war rope that helped a little bit. Somewhere in there we discovered I was right and the baby was totally sunny side up. This meant he was pretty much caught under my pelvic bone, not that I was bad at pushing. Over the course of the next hour and a half my epidural wore off and I let it so I could feel what the heck it was I was doing. They then had me flip to hands and knees, on my side, etc. to try and get him uncaught and moving on. The nurses were impressed I could move myself considering my legs were still all funky from the epidural. I was basically heaving my whole body weight with my arms. 

This is where things got really shitty. The doctor came in briefly but decided that the lady next door was going to deliver first. By 7:20ish we could see his head. They let me see with the mirror which was both awesome and awful because I was so far away from having him out. The nurses went to go get the doctor but he was in the middle of delivering the other baby. He said for me to breathe through the contractions and labor down. That. Fucking. Sucked. At this point my epidural was GONE. Every fiber in my being wanted to push. With every contraction I had to breathe, close my eyes, and use my arms to push on the bed bars so I didn‚Äôt push with the contractions. His head was literally RIGHT THERE but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to push. During this time the nurses went to town with mineral oil and massaging down there. Looking back everyone was really trying to keep me from tearing but at the time I hated everyone, especially my doctor. My nurse kept trying to say laboring down would help prevent tearing but I was beyond reason at that point.

I kept going into myself if that makes sense. I would close my eyes and try to pretend I didn‚Äôt exist. The nurses kept trying to engage me in conversations. I knew they were trying to help but I desperately wanted them to shut up. Luckily my husbands answered their questions for me and they stopped after a while. My main nurse at this point was an angel named Lillian. She kept sending techs running and telling the doctor he needed to get his ass in there. At about 7:45 she let me push with the occasional contraction. Eventually I think she could tell I had reached my limit and if I wasn‚Äôt allowed to push one of my family members was going to riot. She said something to the effect of ‚Äúwell, doctor had his chance to get in here.‚Äú

So at 7:50 ish she let me push. It hurt like a bitch but was SO MUCH BETTER than laboring down. Lillian had the tech and my mom start rubbing my toes because apparently that makes contractions stronger? At this point I was out of my mind and felt super out of control. My husband kept giving me oxygen/holding the oxygen in front of my face so I could breathe it without it touching me. I didn‚Äôt want my contractions to be any stronger and wanted to tell them to stop but couldn‚Äôt. I think Lillian was just trying to get him uncaught from my pelvis but it was awful. It took me weeks to be okay with anything or anyone touching my toes. 

Everything started to become a blur. I began pushing like a mad woman. I was grunting and groaning with every push. Lillian used some sort of numbing stuff because it was a certainty that I was going to tear. I became vaguely aware that the doctor had come in. Any reason I had was gone. I started screaming ‚ÄúI WANT HIM OUT!‚Äù Like an absolute psycho. I kept almost getting him out only for him to slip back ok. My pushing became desperate and crazed. I‚Äôm not sure if I was even pushing with contractions at that point. My doctor wasn‚Äôt in the room but for maybe five minutes before Leo was born.

I had been afraid Leo‚Äôs shoulders would be awful considering all the trouble getting his head out but the second his head was out the rest of him pretty much slid out no problem. He was born at 8:11pm on September 24th. The second he was out it was like I had never been in pain. He was plopped right on my chest and god I had never seen anything more perfect. I just kept staring at his little finger and ears. The nurses had to suction out his mouth because he was super gurgle-y. The placenta delivery was no big thing. My doctor asked if I wanted to see it and I responded ‚ÄúUh I think I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Apparently I get sassy with no sleep and hours of labor üòÖ. I had a second to third degree tear. I felt some of the stitches but I didn‚Äôt really mention it. It hurt so much less than everything else had and I had a baby to look at so I didn‚Äôt really care at that point.

My hospital did the golden hour as part of their standard procedure. It was pretty amazing. I let him breastfeed for a while before letting in my dad, brother, and best friend. We then just all chilled out in the room for a while and admired little man. Eventually we sent my dad for Krystal‚Äôs which ended up being the best thing I‚Äôd ever eaten. 

(He‚Äôs 12 weeks now but I wrote this out a whille back) He‚Äôs almost three weeks old now! Those two nights at the hospital were some of the hardest in my life. He REFUSED to sleep in the bassinet so my husband and I had to sleep in shifts. I also have fairly flat nipples so breastfeeding was shitty until one of the magical nursery nurses brought me a nipple shield and showed me how to use it. Life is just now starting to get into a normal rhythm. Leo is very much a Velcro baby and must be held at all times. He will  tolerate sitting in his boppy lounger next to me. We ended up bedsharing by week two because sleeping in shifts wasn‚Äôt going to work once my husband had to return to his job. 10/10 would recommend. We still have rough nights but overall much much better. I had some really hard nights as far as baby blues and anxiety went but I turned a corner right after week two. PP is harder than I expected but that a post all of its own. Overall I‚Äôm so in love with this tiny human I‚Äôm already trying to convince my husband that Leo needs a sibling.

Boy, do people feel so entitled to validation through your experience. I‚Äôm talking down to strangers, sales associates, cashiers etc. It‚Äôs to the point where I laugh now when I get unsolicited comments because I‚Äôm realizing how specific ideas and language are just ingrained in (Western) pregnant culture. Whether it‚Äôs being told you‚Äôre so ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúhuge‚Äù and you‚Äôre ‚Äúabout to pop,‚Äù being scoffed at for wanting a natural birth or alternative plan to a hospital birth or vice versa etc. I‚Äôve also felt so condescended to- sadly by older women or moms with multiple kids, who seem to think because they‚Äôve had kids before and I haven‚Äôt I must be a total moron, not in the know like them. 

But outside of the unsolicited advice, arbitrary reasoning behind gender guesses, and loaded language with which people carelessly talk to you, I think my biggest one has been ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre just full of pregnancy hormones,‚Äù which comes across as very dismissive. Yes, there are hormones and maybe the reactions and feelings to things are a bit stronger but I‚Äôve gotten the impression it‚Äôs said to me in a way that‚Äôs akin to ‚Äúoh, it must be that time of the month‚Äù where suddenly any capacity for logical, rational thought is just not on the table anymore and I‚Äôve felt helplessly reduced to this antiquated idea of what a pregnant woman is.

1102,"Hi everyone! I can‚Äôt believe it has already been 12 days since I delivered my little girl. I also can‚Äôt believe I almost didn‚Äôt go get checked out. I‚Äôm not a great story teller. 

On December 4th, I clocked into work at 8:30 and got onto the elevator. Suddenly I felt a small gush of fluid. I went to the restroom and saw just a small spot (about the size of a penny) in my underwear. I honestly thought I had peed a little. When I wiped, I also noticed some of my mucus plug. I know you can slowly lose your mucus plug and that it doesn‚Äôt mean immediate labor so I played it off and continued with work. 

I could not shake the feeling that something was wrong. I ended up calling my OB‚Äôs nurse hotline and told her the story. She suggested I go get swabbed for amniotic fluid. The issue is I work one hour in the opposite direction of the hospital where my OB is (I commute to work). So I told my boss and called my husband and made the hour commute to the hospital. 

I get to the hospital around 2 pm and even told the L&amp;D triage nurse that I‚Äôm certain it was just pee because I felt crazy for going through all this. Well, ten minutes later she comes back and tells me that my water had broken and it ‚Äúlooks like your having a baby today.‚Äù I broke down crying because I was alone and this was the last thing I expected. I had not slept or eaten in forever. I had no bag packed. Nothing. They checked me and I was 3 cm. I had not had my 36 week appointment yet to check for dilation, group B, and the ultrasound. 

They put me into the delivery room and start a fluid bolus and pitocin. They told me to tell them when I wanted an epidural an hour before I thought I would need it to give the anesthesiologist on call time to get to the hospital. Now it is 7pm and the pitocin is making me miserable. I‚Äôm vomiting, shaking, and hurting. I tell the nurse I‚Äôm ready for the epidural. 

THREE HOURS LATER the anesthesiologist shows up. It is now 11pm and they want me to rest a couple of hours since I‚Äôm not at 10 cm‚Äôs yet. I sleep from 11pm-1am. 

At 1am they check me and I‚Äôm at 10 cm with contractions close. I start pushing at 1:15. 

I pushed from 1:15 to 4:36 am. They entire time I‚Äôm shaking from the pitocin and vomiting between pushes. It was miserable. The worst part is the downtime between contractions and pushing because the pressure is so intense and you can‚Äôt do anything but breathe through it. 

After all this my little Claire was born at 4:36 am on Dec 5th, 36 weeks and 1 day, 6lbs 10 oz‚Äôs, 19.5 inches long. I had a stage 2 episiotomy. 

They take my Foley out and move me into a postpartum room. Around 11 am, I still haven‚Äôt peed so they bladder scan me and I had 1L in my bladder. They had to put a foley in which was honestly the worst part of it all. I‚Äôm swollen with not pain meds and stitches and they have to spread me and restick a catheter in there. Just thinking about it gives me chills.

I‚Äôd love some opinions on my current situation. I will most likely be having a c-section due the positioning of the baby; my doctor would like this to happen at 39 weeks (nothing wrong with me or baby, just want to prevent me going into labor beforehand) 

39 weeks would be 1/3/19. However, if I can have the c section 3 days earlier on 12/31, I would save well over $7k on insurance and taxes costs. For personal reasons, I would much prefer a 2018 baby. We had several losses that all would have been due in 2018. This way, we would still be getting our baby in 2018.

1113,"Bare with me because this is my first time posting on this sub. I don‚Äôt know where to start with this post so be prepared for some rambling and I‚Äôm sorry for the length. 

My husband and I are both 24, healthy, and expecting our first child in just a couple weeks (due December 29th). We elected to have an early ultrasound to see if the sex of our baby could be determined, we were told it‚Äôs a girl :). At our anatomy scan, the ultrasound tech was having trouble visualizing the baby‚Äôs bladder so we scheduled a follow up ultrasound a few weekends later (we were told this can be pretty common as the baby may had just emptied the bladder). They were still having some issues at the follow up scan and we were referred to an mfm in the area. 

It took 2 appointments with the mfm but the specialist seemed quite confident that nothing was wrong as my amniotic fluid levels were good, baby‚Äôs kidneys weren‚Äôt dilated. They did visualize the bladder but just thought it was on the small side. We left that appointment feeling relieved since the doctor was quite confident there was no
Bladder exstrophy. 

My husband and I moved out of state and I had to find a new OB at around 30 weeks. Everything was great, I actually really like my new doctor way more than the one I was seeing before. We had an additional scan at 32 weeks because my doctor wanted to have an anatomy scan of their own and he was not convinced that the bladder is normal. He referred me to a specialist in my new town. This new doctor seemed much more in depth about looking at all the signs of bladder exstrophy (ambiguous genitalia, low chord insertion, abnormal abdominal wall,location of the bladder) and she looked for things that the other specialist didn‚Äôt. Problem is, I‚Äôm so far along now that it was really difficult for them to get a really good look at all these things! She seems to think there‚Äôs a good chance our baby has bladder exstrophy. 

I didn‚Äôt realize the severity of this complex disease until she pulled out articles showing babies with this condition. Also, she recommended we do a panorama test to confirm that the baby is truly a girl (bladder exstrophy can cause male scrotum to appear as labia because it is split in half). I took the blood test in the hopes (1.) that we would be assured it‚Äôs a girl and if that‚Äôs the case, even if she has this condition, it‚Äôs probably a milder case or (2.) we find out its a boy and are prepared that the baby certainly has bladder exstrophy. Either way I was ready for some sort of answer. 

My results took the full two weeks to come in and when I get an email saying the report is in I check it immediately. The results were inconclusive. Apparently this can happen sometimes but I cried because any sort of answer is what I needed at the moment. 

My OB discussed informed me at my appointment last week that it would be better for him to deliver us at a different hospital that has a better NICU and staff better equipped for the worst case scenario.  The hospital is literally less than 3 miles away than our original hospital but I can‚Äôt help but stress for several reasons. First, we had a scheduled induction scheduled for the 27th because I really wanted to deliver before the new year (I have already paid over a grand for all these extra visits and ultrasounds and deductible will start over). Also, hubby and I have never been to this new hospital and we got used to our original hospital since my weekly appointments are there we took our prenatal classes there. 

I am really hoping that our doctors are just trying to be as cautious as they can since they can‚Äôt determine anything for sure until birth. Part of me thinks they have to be wrong because bladder exstrophy only happens in about 1/40,000 babies. I know this isn‚Äôt rational thinking since they were the ones with all this training but many doctors have never even seen this condition let alone diagnose it before birth. I know this is naive of me to think but I can‚Äôt help but hope this is the case. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure what I am trying to gain from posting this other than getting everything off my chest to strangers because it is really hard trying to explain everything to family when we have no real answers ourselves. They are awesome and have a right to be kept in the loop but it is exhausting trying to explain everything to them. 

Hope all you other mommas are doing great and having a boring pregnancy, thanks for letting me air everything out.

1114,"So the other night I experienced what I could only call a 'glitch in the matrix'. I currently sleep in what will be the babies room as I am rolling around the entire bed all night trying to get comfortable, it's right near my daughters room with only the family bathroom and laundry separating the rooms so I know if she gets up during the night.


I woke thinking I heard her open the door between the hallway and our main living area, so I checked the monitor and there she was fast asleep in her bed. Weird. I checked the time and it was 4.15am. I rolled from my left to my right side and went back to sleep.... Only to be woken (in the exact position I fell asleep in) by my husband entering the room holding our toddler saying 'she was asking for you, I think she came in but couldn't wake you so came to me' (other side of the house). I was confused but just said ok and took her back to bed and got her back to sleep. But before I left the room I checked the time and it was 4.10am.... what? I was so confused I lay awake for hours trying to figure it out.




Last night I woke needing to pee. I lay there debating whether I should hold and go back to sleep or just get up. I decided to get up, I went and peed then decided to have a drink at the sink using my toddlers cup.... Only to notice my feet were not touching the floor. Weird. I extended my toes and the tips of my big toes hit the floor. I was hovering in mid air. Oooooook. I experimented by going up, down and corkscrewing, all in mid air. I MUST be dreaming! I floated back to the room and just for shits and giggles floated to the ceiling, which felt cool against my back, before floating back to bed, getting comfortable and going back to sleep. Only to wake in the exact position I fell asleep in (needing to pee). This time I knew what had happened and was not so weirded out by it.

1115,"Okay guys I‚Äôm (23 female) on here because I‚Äôm nervous about my pregnancy. In the beginning I drank alcohol and did coke and smoked pot before finding out I was pregnant and I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll effect my baby. The alcohol was only three times before 7 weeks.

I‚Äôm genuinely a decent person and I‚Äôve stopped everything and have been drinking water and taking prenatals and eating healthy. I‚Äôm scared though because I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs heart will stop from my earlier use. My question is, will alcohol effect it at all? Will the cocaine cause a later miscarriage?

1116,"FTM, 10 days past due. We have spent the entire pregnancy planning for a homebirth. We have a wonderful midwife and I have a very supportive and excited husband. Today we went in for an ultrasound today to discover that baby is (frank) breech position. Most midwives in Canada will not deliver a breech baby at home.

I've now spent 10 months imagining, prepping for, and telling everyone that will listen to me about, my natural homebirth and this afternoon, in less than 5 minutes with the tech, I found out I will likely need a c-section. 

I am beyond crushed. It has nothing to do with how negative people can be about c-sections. Instead, it has everything to do with why I wanted a natural homebirth in the first place. I have a real fear of hospitals. I soo wanted to do this at home. I wanted to be in a calm and familiar setting. I wanted to have complete control of all of the factors that I could have, a side from the actual birth because only baby can control that üòâ. I wanted to be able to control who would attend the birth... now I'll be surrounded by strangers and a sterile, foreign environment. Doctors also freak me out in general, which is why I elected to have a midwife. I have been praising and defending our choices for 10 months and all of a sudden, all that I had hope for the birth is seemingly impossible. 

I realize that all that matters is that I do what's best for baby. And believe me, that is all that matters right now. I want to deliver a healthy, beautiful, baby. And asap. But, I'm still very much heartbroken. I don't want to tell anyone else right now. So many people advised against us having a homebirth that I just don't want to answer anyone's questions right now (obviously a breech baby could have happened even if I had been planning on a hospital birth from the get go). 

Anyways. Sorry for the long, rambling, post.

1117,"I have my biweekly appointments phasing into weekly appointments as of my next visit this week. 

My boy has always been somewhat active, and my doctor has mentioned that feeling very little movement is common this far along due to the fact that he's getting a little cramped in there. 

But the doctor also has made it very clear that if I feel less than 10 movements in a 2 hour timeframe that I should be calling the maternity ward and go to the emergency department. She didn't give me a reason, and never gives me the chance to ask any of my burning questions. 

I'm worried, but at this point don't have the energy to walk myself to the hospital every time the count doesn't add up. 

I thought maybe my size and height would be a factor, because I'm about 6 feet tall, and a little overweight, but I really am going in blind here. 

Is it expected to have MUCH LESS movement this far along? The heartbeat has always been healthy when given the doppler, but the mystery and lack of explanation on my doctor's orders is really starting to make me scared for my baby. 

TLDR: I don't feel much movement from my baby, and my doctor told me to count out 10 movements within a 2 hour timeframe. I never add up to 10 per 2 hours, and I do not have access to the hospital outside of appointments to visit the ER every time this happens. Is this normal?

1121,"I had my daughter in 2015, from 7-14 weeks I had HG I lost 15 pounds and was sick 24/7. I didn't end up in the hospital only because I was able to not throw up unless I was moving around trying to do something (like shower or get ready). So I just laid in bed for 7 weeks pretty much.

We were staying with my in laws while we closed on our house and she was our first so no little ones to watch. This time we have a 3 year old and are in our own house. So just laying still will not be an option. So my worry is that if it's as bad as last time I may actually end up in the hospital.

Has anyone had it the first time and not the second? 

I'm trying to think ahead in case I have it and these are the two options I thought of please feel free to critique/offer another idea.

1 - my three year old is currently in preschool three mornings a week, I could switch it to 5 day all day (an extra $265 a month) and I would have my husband home when she is, theoretically it would only be for a month or so but it might be kind of a shock for her.

2- she goes to preschool mon/wed/Fri mornings and then usually comes home finishes her lunch and then naps until about 3:30. So maybe I could pay someone to come over on tue/Thurs to watch her and clean up. This option would probably cost more. And I'm a people pleaser to with social  anxiety so I would feel weird about someone in my house even if I needed it.

1123,"Hi guys,

I'm a FTM and I'm only 9+3 but I really just need a vent I guess. Since week 6 I have been battling the most intense nausea I have ever experienced. I constantly feel like I am right on the edge of throwing up *all the time* and sometimes I do. It got so bad after a week when I lost 4lbs that I ended up at the doctor who did a few tests and prescribed me cyclizine because I was so dehydrated and couldn't eat anything. It helped take the edge off for a while but I've still ended up missing a significant amount of work and feeling like crap. The last few days have been really tough and I feel like it's just totally overridden the meds. I'm spending days in a row in bed unable to do much except eat biscuits. I'm back off to the doctor later but I feel like a total let down. If I can't handle this nausea then how am I going to handle any other symptoms down the line? I had my first scan a couple of days ago which was one of the most incredible moments in my life, seeing the wee heartbeat flickering away. I just wish I didn't feel so rotten. I feel like a burden on my husband, I feel like I'm being stupid or needy, I feel like the doctors must think I'm just a wuss. So many women have it way worse than me and manage to go to work and get on with their lives. I feel a bit like I'm being ungrateful.

I don't know. It's probably all the hormones but I just feel so... horrible at the moment. I am so excited about my little Skittle but I just wish I didn't feel so useless and sick all the time. And I don't want to worry my husband by unloading on him (again), he's been so wonderful the whole way through so far.

Typing this out has helped a little.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies, it's really helped. The doctor has switched me to prochlorperazine to see if that helps a bit more and she's signed me off work until after Christmas so I can concentrate on myself. She asked me if there was anything I can reliably eat which is salt and vinegar crisps (chips) which she said is super common! I joked about hoping I can eat Christmas dinner and she advised to put salt and vinegar all over it, but I reckon the host might murder me for that :P Feeling a lot more buoyant now, thank you all so much &lt;3",Feeling really useless and a let down right now,1

&amp;#x200B;

Since my last post my wife and I have been doing several things that we figured might help her through this rough time. The first couple weeks she refused to work and basically sat at home all day. In her defense, she didn't flat out refuse to work, she asked for reduced hours and her boss said you either work full hours or none at all, to which she called in sick. After a few weeks her and her boss were able to sort things out and she's now back to working 3 days a week. It's better than nothing and it's better than her being at home every day, being so isolated and alone also made her very sad. 

She's eating again, she's gained 5 kilograms and she looks a lot better in general. Her anemia is better, she's been on iron supplements and she doesn't look like a ghost anymore. She went to the doc to get her throat checked out and there's nothing of concern, it was infected with a virus and it caused major swelling but it went away after three full weeks of pain. The blood and mucus she was coughing up came from her nose, it was a post-nasal drip that she got after her throat surgery. The surgeon said that the post-nasal drip is something that can last for years, or even be chronic, basically because her surgery was butchered. Well she was pretty pissed about that. 

She also said that she doesn't want to be a mother and never wanted children, which is the major contributor to her depression, but she's learning to cope with both those issues. We've been to the hospital and they have enlisted her in a special treatment plan which involves a psychiatrist that is specialised in prenatal and post partum depressions. 

We also switched midwifes, my wife was more comfortable to have a midwife at the hospital rather than one that was a third party. She also got a medical indiction that she needs to have her baby in the hospital. She can't give birth at home and that's something she really wanted, but she's come to terms with the fact that we will be in the hospital for the birth.

She still smokes, and she still consumes (too much) caffe√Øne. But, so far on all check-ups our little girl is growing properly and has no issues. On all the ultrasounds we were complimented on her health, her organs look very healthy, and one woman even said she had the prettiest heart that she'd ever seen on an ultrasound (really, she kept looking for 10 minutes just how the four chambers were moving around). Her kidneys, lungs, bones and muscles are all also developing properly and there's no reason to think that she's not healthy. We've done the tests on the chromosomes, it came back clean and there's no chance that she has down-syndrome or one of those other spooky diseases you hear about. 

So far, it seems like we're getting a little health girl despite my wife's efforts to ruin her pregnancy. (I don't know if that was her end goal, it just seems like it was if you consider the fact that she doesn't want to be a mother). This little girl is a fighter and basically already telling her mom that there's no stopping her. I'm already proud of my little girl before she's even born. 

There's no more talk about suicide coming from my wife, which is a relief, and I'm also no longer afraid that she's a danger to others around her. Her driving is better and she doesn't fall asleep during the day anymore. Her sleeping is still very disrupted, she wakes up 4-5 times a night and then goes back to sleep again. Usually, between 6 and 10 am she will get up depending on if she can fall asleep again or not. If she's working, she goes to bed at 11PM and if she's not working she goes to bed around 12-1AM. 

Right now she's having trouble (sorry for all FTM's, this is a real issue) feeling when she needs to go to the bathroom for a number 2. That, combined with the fact that her stomach isn't really optimal either (diarrhea), causes her to need ""emergency"" showers quite a lot. She's a bit annoyed by this but luckily she's not embarassed or too scared to share her struggles with me, she even laughs it off and jokes about it quite often. I feel sad for her that this pregnancy literally causes her to poop her pants, I mean no adult should really have to go through that, but on the other hand it's a common side effect of pregnany and shit happens, literally. We make sure we just clean her up the best we can and obviously if she needs my help I will help her, most of the time she does clean herself and her clothes and I just clean where-ever she sat on when it happened. But she's been a really good sport about the whole ordeal and it doesn't seem to bother her much. Just one of the things that comes with pregnancy. 

The last thing I wanted to share with you is that she did self-harm after we got into a fight. Basically she kicked me out for  a night because I had been rude to her, and she was so upset that she had tore the skin of her arm in two different places. She hadn't self-harmed for probably years before this happened and I think this was because of the depression that she now did this. I told her that I wasn't mad at her but that I really wanted her to try and stop doing it again, this time for good. She agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for being here with me and helping me with my wife, it's been a tough time for both of us and we will continue to work on it, I hope that once the baby is out that she will feel happy and like her old self again. I will obviously post updates when our little girl is born.

My daughter was due December 13th, on December 12th my husband and I headed to L&amp;D for my scheduled induction. I was very adamant about being induced, but I knew it was time for her to come and meet everyone. 

I got there around 7:15 PM, and at 9:20 my nurse (I can‚Äôt remember the medication name) stuck a little pill in my cervix to help jump start labor. Within an hour I was feeling cramping, but it wasn‚Äôt unbearable. I wanted to see how long I could go without getting the epidural anyways. Over the next few hours, contractions got stronger and more close together. I ended up asking for the epidural around 3 in the morning. Once that kicked in, I was able to sleep for 45 minutes before my husbands stupid alarm started to go off. When I wake up, I‚Äôm starving. Feel like I‚Äôm gonna die from starvation. So I couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. 

Nurse comes in around 7 and checks me, I was about 3 cm dilated (when I was checked at the hospital I was at a 2, so I was like dang it). So she starts me on pitocin. At this point, I started to feel my contractions again, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. Stupid me. 

About 45 minutes later I tell her my epidural is wearing off, and I‚Äôm having full blown contractions at this point and I‚Äôm in a ton of pain and swearing like a sailor, lol. At this point as well I am having a lot of pain in my upper back and my neck, unbearable. She calls the anesthesiologist and he‚Äôs in the OR, and can‚Äôt make it up yet. I‚Äôm full fledged screaming at this point, especially at my husband who is watching that‚Äôs 70s show and not paying attention to me, lol. 30 minutes later my nurse shows up with the anesthesiologist and says ‚ÄúI pulled him out of the OR for you‚Äù I‚Äôm like thank god. He gives me another round of meds, and I finally chill out. I was around a 5-6 once it kicked in and she checked. That was at 9 AM. 

The nurse had me flipping on different sides of my body throughout being on the epi, and I was on my left side when I started to feel sick. My best friend grabs me a bag and I throw up a lot of liquid. Right after, my nurse and my OBGYN show up to break my water. My OBGYN goes to break it and says ‚Äúher water ruptured on her own, don‚Äôt know when but it could have broke when you got sick just now!‚Äù And after that everything is a blur. I remember pressure, lots of pressure every minute or so. My nurse said once the pressure stays to call her, not long after it was staying. I call her and she flips me over and I can feel my daughters head, I was fully dilated ready to go. 

They laid me flat on the bed and put my feet up to push. My OB has went back to her office for a minute to see a few patients so while she was doing that, I started pushing. And I can‚Äôt even explain how uncomfortable and in pain I was. They wanted me flat, with my chin to my chest and to hold my own legs when I was contracting. As stated earlier, my upper back and my neck hurt so bad, so I feel if I was in a different position, I wouldn‚Äôt have been pushing for 30 minutes but maybe 15-20. Eventually my dr comes back and has them adjust me, so I could push better and easier. 

Finally I was on my final push, so I start to push and feel her head come out. I‚Äôm screaming at this point, and my OB tells me to stop pushing, the cord is around her neck. She cuts it, and I finish pushing, and they put my daughter on my chest. She was blue and purple, and wasn‚Äôt crying. I was crying, why is my baby not crying!? Why is she blue and purple?! The nurses grab her immediately and take her to suction her out and she ended up having to get oxygen. A few minutes later I finally hear her crying, and I am sobbing. I was sobbing the entire time, I just wanted her to be okay. The nurse started patting her chest with some contraption, I‚Äôm assuming to get her blood flow going. Finally, after 30 agonizing minutes, my baby girl is returned to me.

1138,"Hi there, not sure if this is the right place, this is a throwaway because DH knows my regular username.  


I took a PT yesterday and I am pregnant with our second! Sooner than expected, but still very excited!  


For our first, I originally had a surprise planned for DH. However because of some early medical issues, I had to speed up the process, and told him pretty unceremoniously. I know he didn't mind how he found out, he was just excited for our daughter. This time around, I have a much simpler plan, except I am having trouble finding one component, and was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction?  


I bought a card where you can record your own greeting. It is blank, so you can add stuff to it to completely personalize it. My DH's and my first date was when the little theater in our town did a Chris Farley marathon four years ago. We both love Tommy Boy, so here was what I was thinking:  


On the front, I wanted to put [this image](https://ibb.co/W6fcrJm)  


And inside it would open up to [this](https://ibb.co/bQ6CqHD) (don't mind the hastily made mockup)  


I was going to wrap the test up for sanitation reasons, obviously. If it messes up the card working, then I would just take a picture of it with the results and put that in there instead.   


The problem I am running up against is that I need an image that will be 8.5 inches by 6 inches, and so far everything I have found has been too small and when I try to expand it, it gets really pixelated. Any suggestions where I can find larger versions of these stills?

1140,"I had posted recently regarding my 3 year old nephew being in the hospital and wanted to update you and let you know where he's at. This will be long, so thanks for sticking with it. Talking about it helps get all the stress out of my head. Basically no one in my family has slept in a week. 


The neurologist read the MRI and he had a brain stem injury. They aren't exactly sure why it happened, but it has to do with his body dumping any and all potassium he had, so when they were pumping him full of fluids it rushed his brain in such a way that caused damage. I don't pretend like I understand or know what they mean here. His MRI showed white spots or bruising, and a possible stroke. 

They think it's possible he may have a previously undiagnosed mitochondrial disease or genetic condition that was exacerbated by the sickness he had at the beginning of the week. The neurologist did say the brain stem injury was a 1/1,000,000 fluke reaction to his dehydration and there was nothing she could have done to change what happened.

They have tested him for every infectious and viral disease they can think of  and have done a spinal with no answers. His tox screen came back absolutely normal. Aside from being acidotic (his bicarb had steadily been at 11, even with the fluids and medicine they had been giving him. ) but with his most recent draw had gone up to 15. It's supposed to be around 23. But it's an improvement. 

I went and visited him yesterday, and he has had some steady improvements. He is not just asleep all the time. The neurologist declared him in a coma at one point but thankfully he has become more aware and is responsive. 

He speaks as though he has had a stroke, managing some sentences, but a lot of garbled, unintelligible nonsense. He didn't recognize me as his aunt, and he doesn't recognize his sister. But he knows who his mom and dad are, and he really doesn't like the nurses, but who would like someone who gives them suppositories?


He has his sense of humor still, which is amazing. His mom was telling me how he has stinky breath cuz he can't brush his teeth currently and she went to kiss him and I told him to blow his stinky breathe in her face and he smiled, and did. She kissed him and then he asked for another kiss and when she leaned in he blew a bigger breathe in her face and kinda giggled.

He has a central line and an NG tube right noe and is seeing OT, PT, and Speech daily  to assess and help him.


And tomorrow the geneticist will come in and do a work up, but that will take a week to come back.


We've never been thru something like this and it's been terrifying. At first it was easy to point blame at what seemed like an obvious cause, but with all of his doctors being so unsure only time will give us answers as his results continue to trickle in.

My husband and I have been married for about a year and a half and I‚Äôll be 8 weeks pregnant this week. The pregnancy is a dream come true! We‚Äôve both always really wanted a family and we waited what felt like forever to be in a place to try to have a baby. We have cried so many happy tears and said so many prayers of gratitude for this baby. We already love him/her so much ‚Äî when I saw that sweet little heart beat for the first time, my entire life and perspective changed. I felt willing to move mountains to keep the sweet little bean healthy and happy. 

But the ‚Äúmorning‚Äù sickness has put a damper on my attitude. I guess I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this bad (1) because why do people have multiple kids if they have to endure this misery several times? and (2) neither my mother nor my MIL ever even vomited during their pregnancies. Luckily my OBGYN has prescribed me some nice medicine, but it‚Äôs still awful. I vomit every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Then there‚Äôs the constant bloating and gas pain and nausea and food aversions... it is so much. I‚Äôve never felt worse, physically or emotionally. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just these crazy hormones, but the morning sickness experience has taught me I had a sugar-coated view of pregnancy and motherhood. Now I‚Äôm terrified of everything I‚Äôve underestimated ‚Äî how hard is it going to be to give birth, learn to breastfeed, miss all my sleep for a newborn, and teach a baby to be a person for the next 18 years? Previously I thought all those things would be hard but bearable ‚Äî but I also thought morning sickness would be hard but bearable, and right now it feels pretty unbearable. I feel discouraged and like I maybe didn‚Äôt know what I was getting myself into üòÖ

TL;DR: I‚Äôm 8 weeks pregnant and it‚Äôs a dream come true. But ever since the sickness hit, I just feel terrified about all the discomfort I underestimated and like I am not prepared handle this whole pregnancy/birth/motherhood thing.

Anyway, my mom wanted to come stay from out of state and help with the baby after she is born. I totally expected this and am so grateful for that. However, she wanted to come on the baby‚Äôs due date instead of when she is actually born.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about this because I knew there was a possibility of going late and maybe getting sick of my mom staying here so long.

Or ‚Äúenjoy going to dinner now, because once that baby comes out, you won‚Äôt be going anywhere‚Äù

Most of the time I just smile and nod, however I get this strong urge to ask him if his experience with a newborn was so terrible, that he has nothing but negative things to say to us about our upcoming baby. Yes, babies cry, it‚Äôs how they communicate. And no we don‚Äôt plan to go out drinking. But seriously. It‚Äôs mainly him with the negative comments, and everyone else seems to be mostly positive about our new baby. But I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with the comments that come from my own father in law. It‚Äôs almost starting to drive a wedge between us, and I don‚Äôt want to cause any grief.

1164,"I'll start by saying, I know I am extremely lucky to be given so much time to stay home and to get paid for it. I'm from the US originally but now live in Northern Europe where we get a ton of paid leave. I appreciate it but I still have different feelings about it and I'm struggling with both mom guilt and being mom shamed already. 

Daycares around here don't take babies until they are at least 12 months old and even then they may make you wait longer if there isn't a space in the daycare you chose. So one of us has to be home full-time until the baby is at least 1 maybe even longer. Private daycares before 12 months aren't an option as they don't exist and a nanny is rare and insanely expensive. 

My husband and I get 480 days to share between each other. He makes wayyy more money than I do so it makes more sense for me to be the one to stay home that year. So he'll pass some of his days over to me. People are shocked that he really only wants to keep the mandatory 90 days he has to take and that he won't be staying home for more time. He doesn't really want to stay home for 6 months straight and I honestly can't blame him for that. A lot of people take 3-4 days paid so they can stretch their leave out for longer and then one parent stays home 1-1.5 years then the other 6ish months. But that means a hit to the monthly income that we just can't take. 

The look of horror on others faces when I say I will be home a maximum of one year only if I can doesn't help either. I have had many conversations from others who are either pregnant or have kids on how 12 months is way to early to put him in daycare and that I should be home at least a year and a half. 

Thing is, I love working. I love being around adults and having adult conversations. I finally got a job in this country after moving abroad and I am feeling sad that I'll be losing that (my contract sucks so they don't legally have to keep the job for me to come back to and people are already eyeballing it so...it's gone). So after a year I'll be back at zero looking for a job again with sucky language skills for where I live. Which I'll be working to improve but it's not gonna be anywhere near what I need to work in my field after a year. Of course, if I do find a job earlier than a year that pays decently, my husband will stay home instead and I'll go to work. But that is a slim chance in my mind. It's looking more and more like I'll need to go back to school at some point. 

I know that for the first couple of months I will be glad to be home but the thought of being home for 12 months or more scares me. I am worried about boredom and not being the best mom I can be due to that. I know there are tons of mom groups around town but I'm worried about losing the ""adult"" time I have now at work. 

I'm just curious if anyone else had these thoughts. I feel guilty for thinking them sometimes as me being from the US, a lot of my other pregnant friends back home would kill to have even 12 weeks off and paid. 

But did anyone else not really love the idea of staying home? How did you manage it? Did you find you liked it in the end? Any tips or thoughts are appreciated! 

TLDR: Country, where we live, doesn't have childcare options until the child is 12 months or older.

We really want to start trying next month but we keep feeling iffy as we want to make sure we are a tad more stable financially.

With my first I started around a BMI of 25, was starving all the time from week 12 on, and if I didn't eat every couple hours in those middle months I felt light headed and low blood sugar symptoms.

We've been trying to conceive for about six months now; I've been temping and using progesterone cream to try to increase our odds of success.

I also started to feel queasy a few days after my period, but I was pretty sure it was due to stress at work.


Finally, at 18DPO, I picked up a pregnancy test on the way to work and took it, just to prove to myself that I was imagining things and that I wasn't pregnant--and I got a very faint positive.  I freaked out and called my husband.  He brought me another test, and it was positive too.  


I made an appointment with my doctor.  They tested my urine and the test came back negative.  I told the doctor I was having symptoms, and so he ordered a blood test just to be sure.  It came back positive, but very low: 35.  When I told him the latest possible day that I could have conceived (which meant I had to be about five weeks pregnant) he indicated that the low number was a bad sign.

1,"My period cycle is pretty annoying to me - I start spotting about 3 days before it starts, then I bleed like crazy for 2 days, and then there are varying degrees of spotting and bleeding for another 3-5 days. So altogether, I need to wear my menstrual cup for over a week.

Also, my cycle has recently become a lot shorter, from about 30-35 days down to 26-28 days. So I bleed more often.

6,"Sorry for the wall of text but I have a lot of background story. But TL:DR my periods have changed drastically over the last 23 years and I'm concerned.

I used to have super heavy periods - I would go through 7 or 8 tampons a day. At night I would have to put a towel on my bed because I would leak through my tampon, heavy overnight pad, underwear and pajama bottoms. This was how my periods were from the age of 9-29. Super heavy, rich blood color, not too dark, not too light, but a good deep red, for 7-9 days with 3 weeks between the last day of one to the beginning of the next one. I never had too much clotting maybe one or two noticeable ones every few months. I was on birth control from 20 years old on. 
Then around 29 my periods got shorter, and I would have a few days of brown blood after- old blood I guess. So 3 day periods and 2-4 days of light, but still there brown blood.
Then a year or so later it turned into light blood - still red but not too rich. And I would have this for about 5-6 days. The thing with this is I didn't need tampons- I could get away with pantiliners and for the most part they'd be clean. Blood was only there when I wiped. It was too light for light tampons - they would come out dry even after 4 hours. 
Now I'm finally having ""real"" periods again - fresh red blood, but only need light tampons and some days just pantiliners. They're light though- and last only a few days. 
My gynecologist and my naturopath and my GP have no explanation for me other than periods change all the time. My naturopath had me go off of birth control and after a 2 month break put me on iron and maca supplements for a whole year - this seemed to mess me up even more - I would essentially have a 2 week period. Light bleeding for 4 days, no blood at all for 2 days, then my standard light period I described above (no tampons needed)for 5 days, and a few very light days after. Naturopath had no explanation for this so I stopped the treatment plan I was on.

My thyroid levels are fine, my iron is a little low but not enough to be concerned. 
The only other body changes I can link this to is weight. Until about 27 I could eat a cow and all the cheese, milk and butter it produced over it's life and A) never get ""full"" and B)  not have much effect on my weight. But I went through a year or two of weight gain after 27 - from 150ish lbs to 180. 
For the last 2 years I don't have much of an appetite, I can eat but nothing close to what I ate. Sometimes I force myself to eat a piece of bread or some rice because i'm worried about a gastritis flare if I have an empty stomach. Through all this, I now weigh 209lbs. My activity level is the same since my early 20s - yoga once or twice a week, and for the most part I keep busy throughout the day - I have an office job but everytime i've used a fitbit or anything I see that I walk close to 20,000 steps a day on average. 

I have an appointment next month with my gynecologist to get my annual. I wanted to see if anyone here has had similar changes with their periods, if you have any insight to it, what's worked for you, and if it's related to weight or if I should be looking at these two issues separately. Am I perimenopausal?

i have always had painful cramps with my period, but i know that Ibuprofen works pretty well for me. I usually take 400mg each 6 hrs and get through the baddest 12-24 hrs until its fine. I'm doing it that way for many years now.

But i was always wondering about something. I have an app that helps me predicting my period, but of course its not too precise. If i get it one or two days earlier, its very likely it catches me in my sleep. When i wake up from the cramps, i feel there is a certain point when its already too late to take Ibuprofen, or the wrong time at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

When i get cramps at night, i don't fully wake up and just 'bear' the pains because i'm so sleepy. I even feel them in my dreams and have this half awake/half sleep state. When it gets unbearable, i take sometimes 800mg (still in bed) and it just DOESN'T WORK. 

It should work as usual within 30-40 mins (at least for me). But hours pass, and there is no sign that the pains get any way lighter. Last time it took 3 hours until it had an relieving effect. I was on the edge of crying, crouching in pain. It just gets worse and worse, and i was wondering if it is connected with my stomach or my biorhythm, that my body can't fully absorb the substance sometimes. Or is it connected with not drinking enough water to it? When i wake up at night, i just take a sip to swallow the pill. Do i need a full glass of water instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Ibuprofen seems to work for me properly only when i have eaten something before and am fully awaken and my body 'starts' getting active. Does that make any sense?

34,"I turned 20 this year, and in the past few months my period has become infinitely worse. Now, I always vomit on the first day. At first I would just throw up once and feel better afterwards, but the frequency has increased to 4 times in one day. The idea of eating disgusts me, so I usually end up dry heaving, but the nausea doesn't go away. Last time, I retched blood when there was no food left. The cramps feel like absolute hell. I can barely stand‚Äì I can only roll around in bed, crying and groaning. As drowsy as it makes me feel, the pain prevents me from sleeping. I can't even take painkillers because I can't keep food down. At least these symptoms only last for 2-3 days, but the entire time is pure torture.

&amp;#x200B;

I am seriously terrified of my next period. It's so difficult to go to work while I'm going through it, especially since I have to stand up all day in a hectic environment full of men. I've tried to make an appointment with an OBGYN (whom I've never visited before) but I haven't been able to get a date before my next period, which is due in \~1.5 weeks. I'm willing to do anything (except get pregnant) to get out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way I can stop it at this point? If not, what can I do to stop the vomiting and make the pain bearable? Please help me :(

35,"Out of curiosity, I wanted to know if anyone has ever experienced the phenomenon of a light flow during some bought of sickness.

Over the last two weeks or so I have been sick with a fairly common head cold. Roughly halfway through I started a very light cycle and it has been varying in heaviness while I was sick. I no longer feel the symptoms but my menstrual bleeding is still lingering. It hasn't been long enough to cause alarm yet.

On the other hand, since I've experienced a tragic death in my family, I have been in a severely increased sense of paranoia over what my body does. I've read that is a side effect. I've experienced prolonged bleeding before but it was not during an illness. I saw an OB-GYN and received a shot of progesterone aside from a rather traumatic visit from that doctor.

98," I‚Äôm not sure if I should see a gynecologist about this or not, so I‚Äôd like some input first to see if something is wrong or if it‚Äôs just that my body is naturally weird.

So, for one, my periods are and always have been really mild. I‚Äôve never used a tampon and I‚Äôve definitely never needed one. Most periods I can go through a day with only a couple pad changes. As I‚Äôve gotten older (started at 12, I‚Äôm 24 now) I‚Äôve somehow gotten even lighter and now I don‚Äôt even have a problem just wearing a normal pad at night (I used to at least need a longer one or a second one up the back because it would flow back). I can get cramps around my period, but typically just as it starts and it‚Äôs very short lived and not severe. PMS also doesn‚Äôt really affect me very much.

However, it‚Äôs my ovulation that seems to be odd. I‚Äôve always had more problems around my ovulation. Primarily, I see my mood change much more and I can get awful cramps. These cramps often are a sharp stabbing or bloating feeling in my lower stomach, near my vagina, and up my rectum. Sitting, clenching, etc. all hurt a lot. I have a high pain tolerance due to chronic pain and various chronic issues, but even these just end up too debilitating to me. It doesn‚Äôt happen every month, thank goodness, but it‚Äôs been that way since I was a teen.

I also feel very gross while ovulating? Most people tell me they feel more attractive and confident around their ovulation, which makes sense, but I feel far from. I get so much discharge it feels like I‚Äôm wetting myself and I regularly sweat, so I feel as if I need to shower two or three times a day.

The last main thing that I experience is the same type of ovulation cramping/pain, only right between my ovulation and period (so a week after my ovulation, week between my period). Thankfully, this insane cramp only happens once a cycle if it happens in a cycle, but it can last hours and leave me bedridden.

Some things I should probably note is that ibuprofen does seem to help for pain, at least to an extent. I also don‚Äôt take BC and I‚Äôm not and have never been sexually active. My doc said because I‚Äôve never been sexually active that a pap smear would be highly unnecessary, but if things are so strange I‚Äôm a bit concerned that something may be wrong.

I just do not understand why I'm spotting. I even track my cycles which are normally 25-28 days on average. I've never spotted before. The other day I wiped myself after I peed and there was blood. I was flabbergasted because it was only cycle day 17! I've never (even as a teen) had cycles that short. So I used a pad, thinking it was period blood, but there was literally nothing on it by the time I got home. 

Sorry to get graphic, but I noticed blood again after pooping, which isn't abnormal when I'm actually on a period because the pushing just causes more blood to come out. It was bright red. I woke up today, no blood. Went pee about half an hour ago, and there was pinkish blood.

What is going on?!? I'm just getting pissed off because I've NEVER spotted before in my life. I've only ever bled from periods or a masturbation session that got too aggressive (very rare).

Period came on time on September 24. Day 1 was normal, days 2,3,4 were exceptionally light and there was no day 5, which is unusual. I thought maybe it was due to weight loss (periods used to be 4 days when I was younger/thinner). 

Partner was a little too aggressive on Sept 29. My nipples were very sore the next day and I still have mild tenderness since then. 

According to my app, ovulation occurred on/around Oct 6, had intercourse with protection again that night. Last night (Oct. 7), I started bleeding.

I have an IUD, and Im using a menstrual cup. This has been working fine, but during my last period I got terrified because I could feel my cervix so easily! Its been hard for me to reach it before but now it was so near the vagina opening. Now, Ive read that during your menstruation your cervix is lower, which is normal. I have my following menstruation now, starting yesterday, and my cervix is even lower than last time. Right over my urethral meatus/urethra? Can your cervix change position even from one menstruation to another? Ive read that the menstrual pains and amount of bleeding can be different depending on which ovary is ovalating, but position of the cervix?
Ive had the cup for maybe a year but always felt like my cervix is in the way back. My cup also intend to ""dissapear"" really far in during sleep so Ive learned to wait a couple of hours after I wake up before I take it out, because its easier. Feels like the vagina is more relaxed after a while. Normal?

I just now learned that the menstrual cup is supposed to be (for some women) in a position where your cervix is kinda inside the cup. I find this also terrifying since Im really scared I will damage the IUD, but I guess as long as I make sure I release the vacuum before taking the cup out, I should be fine. Is there anything else there I should think about or be careful with? 

Also! I think my menstrual pains are increased by the cup. Everyhing Ive read says that the vacuum should not effect the cervix or give pain, but it really feels like it does. But it could also be that the muscles in the vagina are kinda sore/tired since they are used to keep the cup in position. Thoughts? ","Help me please!

I am 35 and have only had a period about 5 times in my life, all before age 17. At 17 they stopped totally and haven't come back until last night.

  Well, my period started when I was 12, but since that time, it was... weird, too much blood for a long time (3w or 1month almost 2) with too long pauses, lol
  Im lesbian so I wasnt worrying about being pregnant, so, yeah.
  And then some shit started happening, I was very stressed by the school, Ive been bullied and in an anxious kind of school for years, and my home wasnt very different (rofl ironically), and then... My period started, okay, 1 month later, okay, thats commom for me, 2 months... okay thats weird? Im feeling tired and such, (for u understand how much blood it was, I used to use adult diapers, and they usually get full lol), 3months after... okay lets go to a doctor make a blood exam(test? Idk). Yeah, anemy confirmed. (I could tell about the doctor that called me fat and lazy and said he was pretty sure it wasnt anemy but-- naahh (: I hate bad doctors). 
  Well, you wanna know what I had/have? Nothing lol 
  One time in ultrasound they found some cysts in my ovaries, but thats commom (poltcystic ovarian). Yeah, I made some hormonal exams too, nothing again.
  The only thing doctors told me is that this could be stress... and hell yeah I got a severe depression weeks later that time of period lol, my body was just screaming and trying to kill me because I was already too anxious, depressed and sick. (Im not counting the times I was vomiting very bad and needed to go to the hospital a lot of times, or the headaches, or the diarrheas).
  Depression sucks, and its a REAL problem guys, trust me, feeling sad and wating to die IS A LITTLE THING in this shit. I dont know if men have some of THAT bad problems when they're depressed or not, but hey, now I take medicines for it (effexor for depression and anxiety and quetiapine to sleep), and Im better, if I were in my worse stage of depression, I wouldnt be writing here because... I did do nothing all the time, didnt have mood for it lol. 
  My period is still very weird, but its not bleeding too much (but still being in it for weeks or one month) , still with long pauses of 4-6 months, but thats good for me, staying in period is not nice so... yeah, thats it.

Did great for years, cramps were still pretty awful but an Advil would nip them in the bud pretty easily. 

Flash forward to this last year, and now the week before my period I start getting what I can only find searches for as either a yeast infection or BV. Just very itchy, and some thicker discharge that only accumulated around my hood. No smell.
Then I start getting constipated, and then I start getting a horrible pain that lives right  in the center of my abdomen, just below my last ribs. Like bloated feeling to the max, painful to press on ( not excruciating, just very noticeably sensitive). I get horrible gas cramps, paired with my normal period cramps.

A few years ago my period started getting...Really jacked up. I had a period for about 7 months and it just kept getting heavier and heavier. At first I was terrified because I had no idea what was wrong and I just kept telling myself it would stop. Eventually I gave up and told my mom and I got in to the doctor as soon as I could. They did an ultrasound and did bloodwork and they didn't find anything other than me being anemic since I was bleeding so heavily.

‚Äã

My cramps would get to the point where I would pass out, my legs would give out, and I wouldn't even be able to stand up. I would be in the bathroom for hours bleeding so heavily I couldn't get off the toilet and when I finally could I wouldn't have the strength to do anything but sit on the bathroom floor for a while. I finally got on a birth control that helped it for a few months before it started up again. I went 3 months and then took the placebo pill because of how messed up my periods have been (and I still do this and my new doctor suggested I do it). Unfortunately my doctor at the time told me to double up on pills so I ended up overdosing on estrogen so not only did I have to find a new birth control but a new doctor as well because I had become suicidal.

‚Äã

Things had been going relatively well until a few months ago. I missed ONE pill because I ran out and the pharmacy refused to refill it. This happened back in late May. That same night my period started immediately and has not stopped since. My doctor now told me the only thing to do is to deal with it and lose weight. I KNOW I'm overweight (300+ pounds unfortunately due to these health issues) but with my period like this I can't lose weight at all. My bleeding is not very heavy at this moment but I'm in constant pain due to cramping, I'm exhausted all the time, and...Let's just say I'm in the bathroom a lot and it isn't due to bleeding (especially after I eat which is very strange and annoying). I also keep getting UTIs because I've been bleeding so long. I've asked about a hysterectomy before to just stop the pain and both doctors have refused because apparently I'm too young to make that decision (I'm 27).

‚Äã

After about 7 ultrasounds and a few pap smears my new doctor still can't find anything wrong with me. Luckily I'm no longer anemic because the bleeding isn't that bad but I still have 0 answers. I know sometimes I have an incredibly sharp pain on the left side and sometimes it gets so bad the pain will radiate up my side and hit about right below my ribcage. The pain keeps me up at night and trying to work + go to school full time is becoming a struggle. My cramps have gotten so bad that even my primary physician gave me a handicap in case of emergencies (like if I had to run to the grocery store to get medicine and tbh I haven't used it because despite it being mine I still feel awful about it because I'm only in my 20's and I know other people need those spots more than I do).

173,"So just recently I noticed I've been spotting after my period and I've never done so before. Except I'm not sure what spotting is supposed to look like and I feel like this isn't it. It's been about 1 week since my last period ended and I keep getting really thick, very sticky, mucusy black coloured blood. It has almost no odour and deffinetly doesn't smell like a period. The weird thing is that for the first few days after my period ended I had some light bleeding but only 2days ago I started with the thicker blood. 

There's no pain or itching so I don't think it's an infection and it's way too light to be a miscarriage.

Long story short, I‚Äôve been on BC pills in the past, but not for over 5 years. Over the past few years, where before I would spot for maybe half a day before my period ‚Äúactually‚Äù started, I now spot for anywhere from 5-7 days beforehand. It‚Äôs usually either pink or brown and a small amount (not enough to wear a tampon really).  When it first started it was usually only 2-3 days before. It seems to be increasing in length and the last 6 months it‚Äôs been at least 5 days, sometimes a whole week before. 

This is insanely annoying as I still have my actual period for about 5 days after this, then spotting 2 days as it finishes. So basically I‚Äôm bleeding 50% of the time, and once in a while during ovulation too. 

I read somewhere it was due to low progesterone, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs accurate.  Has anyone experienced this and actually found an effective solution? (Besides the pill). TIA!",Bleeding 2 weeks per month,0

This is my third period ever and I'm not sure if the symptoms I'm experiencing is normal or if I should make an appointment to see my OBGYN. Here's what's been happening.

My period had been coming on for a couple of days and I had just my regular discharge, PMS symptoms and everything else that leads up to my horror show every 21 or so days. Well, last Sunday, I started bleeding...and not a little bit of bleeding but a heavy flow with blood combined with my regular vaginal discharge. I've had a lot of mild to severe cramping to go with it. If I had to rate the pain...it would probably be about a 5-6. I don't necessarily have it bad enough or sustained enough I could only stay in bed...but its bad enough I don't want to do much. Stuff like Midol, ginger and other treatments work in taking only the edge off of the pain...but it doesn't bring total relief.  The thing is...the pain and bleeding doesn't seem to want to let up and this particular cycle doesn't want to end. 

Is this type of period normal?

Is it time I ask my mom to make me (15) a appointment with the OBGYN?

194,"Hello! Can someone please help me figure out what might be wrong with me? Ok, so I'm 20 years old and I've been having really weird periods lately. They've always been pretty regular (even when I first started having them) and would only last about 4 or 5 days at most, rarely any cramps and no clots. Btw, I'm not on any birth control.

My last regular period was in February and lasted for 5 days, then after that I didn't have a period for a bit over 2 months (I wasn't pregnant because I'm still a virgin). 

Towards the end of April I got my period, but this time, it was pretty heavy, lasted for 12 days, and had blood clots. 

In May, I had one day that I thought I was starting my period then nothing after that for about 11 days. Then, I had my period for 6 days, a bit more like my usual periods but slightly heavier and with blood clots. 

Last month, I had two separate days when I thought I was starting my period because it was moderate but had nothing for about a week after the second day. Then I had a pretty heavy period for 9 days with bigger blood clots than before. 

This month, I've been having my period for about 16 days now. It started out fairly light for the first few days but then it got heavier on a few days and when I think it's about to stop, it gets heavier again. I really hope that it'll stop today, this is the longest period I've had. 

Over these past months, I've bled three different times onto where I've been sitting because I've misjudged when I needed to change my pad and a few other times through my pants. I've been feeling weaker and more tired in past months and have been sleeping too much but I don't know if it's due to my menstruation or something else because I also haven't had the best sleep schedule but I'm working on fixing it. I don't know if it could be PCOS because along with my periods, I've been losing a bit more hair than usual, and I've noticed that I've had some facial hair growing under my sideburns and slightly down to my jaw (I don't know if I've always had it but it's just a bit more noticeable to me). I don't have any acne problems. I don't know if it's much of a difference but I'm kinda tall and slightly overweight by about 10 pounds.

195,"So recently I have found that there is a debate about replacing free condoms with free menustration products.Im not a feminist but I do have to admit that this would most likely be beneficial to many women.You see,the reason to this that has been said many times is,""Sex is a choice,menustration is not."".In which I totally see the point.Now I kind of made a list of pros and cons of free condoms and free pads:

Free condoms

Pros:

‚Ä¢You don't have to worry about buying condoms from suspicious conviniant stores or gas stations that could be pretty sketchy.

‚Ä¢You can get them anytime from a trusted doctor

‚Ä¢You don't need to use money to buy them.

Cons:

‚Ä¢Teens might depend on condoms to prevent pregnancy (you still have to be cautious during sex)

‚Ä¢Condoms are more available to children and pre-teens

‚Ä¢Some condoms (glow in the dark,scented,etc.) can lead to infections.

Free Tampons/Pads:

Pros:

‚Ä¢Women don't have to spend extra money on menustration products.

‚Ä¢Women who can't afford menustration products now have easy access.

‚Ä¢Girls in school won't have to call parents,go to the school nurse,or ask others for tampons/pads

‚Ä¢Girls won't have to try to survive a day at school if they didn't bring anything and there period came unexpectedly

Cons:

‚Ä¢Companies won't make any money selling products.

‚Ä¢Companies might run out of products.

‚Ä¢Women/Girls could abuse free tampons/pads

196,"I'm a heavy bleeder.  In high school, on my heaviest days, I couldn't sit through a 50 minute class without changing an overnight pad.  I eventually switched to period cups with reusable pads. The cups I'm using have little volume markers under them, and hold about 30 mL of fluid, meaning I can track exactly how much I've been bleeding over time.  I generally release around 240-450 mL (avg \~310mL) of blood/fluid over 8-9 days with a cycle length of \~25 days. This means I bleed about 4.5 L per year.

However, I just read in this article:[http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/resources/very-heavy-menstrual-flow](http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/resources/very-heavy-menstrual-flow) that the average blood released during a period is just 30 mL (less than a cup!) and that over 80 mL is considered menorrhagia (excessive, heavy bleeding).  I bleed 3x more than that on my lightest months!

I'm 20 years old and a healthy weight with an average time of 38 days between periods, with 30 days being the closest together they'll be and 48 days being the longest between. My period is usually 3-4 days long with 6 being the longest. I've been tracking my periods since April 2017. 

I've only cramped during my period maybe twice ever, but I get really really intense leg pains. I have nerve problems, but what happens to my legs doesn't feel like nerve pain. I'm very familiar with nerve pain. What happens feels deeper, like it's in my bones or something. It'll affect both legs, hips, knees, and sometimes ankles. I avoid exercising and walking as much as I can during my period, though it does not get any better when I'm laying down or sitting. I'll be achy a few days before my period up to either a day or so before it ends or a day after it ends. 

But, as said before, it's been 54 days, which is a really long time. I can usually predict my period by my achy legs. When my legs ache, it'll usually come in a few days, but, as of typing this, my legs feel fine and there's no other indication it'll happen any time soon.

But, for the most part, I never take it late. Like out of a month's worth of pills, I maybe take 3-5 ""late"" (by which I mean, minutes after 7:00pm sharp). I use the period tracker app and it has averaged my period's arrival to 53 days, which is pretty spot on.

I am married and presently don't use any other form of birth control (like, at all, not even ""pull and pray"") and so far I haven't gotten pregnant (phew) but... what is happening here? I have tried googling on my own to figure out if I'm somehow still fertile despite taking the pill every single day without fail (I have NEVER missed a pill entirely), but I come up empty handed. I don't understand how I'm getting a regular period, even if it's a weird, every-other-month period.

When I do get my period, it is either a hell period where I fill my Diva Cup multiple times, have intense cramping, it lasts for a week, and I just generally feel like a pile of shit, OR, it's super light (my last one was 1.5 days long), with no real symptoms other than fatigue and being a bit ratty in general :P I don't understand T\_\_T

I am not sure if I want kids (yet, or at all), but I feel more passionately about not having a period. I just... don't want it? lol. I have bipolar type 2 and avoiding the hormone fluctuations a period brings about really helps keep my mood stabilized. Moreover, I just find periods annoying lol. People (naturopaths especially) have preached to me about how a period is natural and you ""wouldn't stop pooping!"" and stuff like that, but I REALLY don't care, so please don't bother telling me. As far as I'm concerned, a period is part of reproduction, which I presently am not interested in, so why should I have to bother with the worst part of the process when I don't even know if I want kids at all? Anyhoo... my goal is to STOP my period until I decide if I want kids or not, and to understand why I'm getting a regular one at all.

Any ideas? Am I at risk for getting pregnant? Why is this happening? Anything I should try doing (I have thought about taking the pill an hour earlier every day)? Any help is massively appreciated...","Taking birth control continuously (no breaks), but get period every 53 days?",0

I am 14 years old and about two weeks ago, I had my first ever period. I had some cramping and a fair amount of discharge with some light bleeding (dark brown in color)...nothing really eventful aside from it being my first cycle. That lasted about 3-4 days and quit. A couple of days later, I started bleeding reddish brown almost rust colored blood. That and it's cramping only lasted about a day or so. This morning, I woke up and I started having cramping from around my pelvis over toward the right side (not totally to the right side of my body...just to the right side of my belly button). It's been kinda off and on all day. It seemed to be at its worst when I was at softball practice this evening. I'm also having a milky like discharge that has a little bit of an odor to it...I can't really describe the smell. So here's what I'm wondering...

1. I don't remember getting injured there. Could this cramping be me ovulating for the first time?
2. If this is me ovulating, usually how long does a woman's ovulation cycle last?
3. Is it normal for a woman to feel this way when she ovulates?
4. Not related to ovulation...but related to periods. With this being my first period, is what I experienced during my first a prelude to what I'm going to experience when I have future periods? Is it possible for a woman's period to change over time?

For the past year, I've been suffering heavily from OCD, anxiety, and depression. I had an inkling that my hormones might be making it worse, but my therapists always told me that it was either random anxiety, or I wasn't using my coping skills well enough. I tried Lexapro for a bit but it made my anxiety worse and stopped my menstrual cycle in its tracks.  I quit the medicine after a month, and the next day my cycle continued where it had left off.

240,"Hello, so really I‚Äôm looking for some advice // to speak to someone who is going through or has gone through the same situation as I‚Äôm currently going through. 
Apologies for the length of this post but there‚Äôs a lot to get through. 
My periods were always pretty normal back when I was younger (I‚Äôm now 21). I was put on rigevidon as a form of birth control due to heavy periods and bad pain when I was about 15/16 and was on this for approximately 3 years with no problems. I then changed to the depo, came off that after about a year due to some small issues, and then the beginning of 2017 I was put on Cerelle. I was only on Cerelle for about a month as it didn‚Äôt mix well with my mental health at all. I have now been birth control free for over a year. 
After I came off of Cerelle I didn‚Äôt begin bleeding again until August time. I had a few normal periods then basically all hell broke loose. 
I have been constantly bleeding since October last year. Some days my bleeding is minimal (but always still there) and others it‚Äôs extremely heavy. The colours range from brown, to bright red, and occasionally a very dark red. 
I‚Äôve noticed that on days where I‚Äôm not bleeding a lot, I can cough/sneeze and then out of nowhere I‚Äôm bleeding ridiculously heavily, it‚Äôs so horrible. I‚Äôve honestly forgotten what it feels like to wear underwear without a pad. 
I plucked up the courage to call the doctors about this a couple of weeks back because I‚Äôm so fed up. 
I was put on tranexamic acid to try and stop the bleeding. I took 2 x 500mg pills three times a day for four days and this didn‚Äôt help at all. After the tranexamic acid I left it a couple of weeks to see if I would stop bleeding at all but nothing has changed. So I called the doctor again earlier in the week and they‚Äôre finally getting some tests done. 
I‚Äôve had a blood test, and some swabs done to check for STI‚Äôs (although it‚Äôs been 3+ years since I‚Äôve had any sort of sex so I highly doubt it‚Äôs that) The doctor has also referred me for an ultrasound so I‚Äôm just waiting on the letter to come through with my appointment. 
If anyone has gone through anything similar at all and has any advice on what it could be and how to cope please let me know!

But now I'm not so sure. I took my week off and had my period about 3 weeks ago, all fine. Did week 1/3 of the new month, which was fine except the patch got a little rucked up. Still stuck pretty firm, just less of it in contact with my skin. This has happened before so I thought nothing of it, carried on having sex as normal with my husband.

When it came to change day and I started week 2/3 by the end of my change day I was bleeding like a period (already unusual for a period. They usually start on day 3 after removing the patch) and I'm now on day 5 of bleeding (where a period would usually be 4).

269,"So my last cycle was the first time I used a menstrual cup. I bought the Diva cup (stupid me, didn't do research, just though, ""oh this one seems popular so why not?"") and so far things aren't gong great, as I'm sure you've already figured out. I went through the struggle of trying to get it in, and finally managed to figure out a way to get it in without it popping open in the middle of insertion. 

Taking it out on the other hand, I still haven't mastered. Every time I take it out, because it's not folded, it stretches me and hurts like a bitch. Not sure if there's any way to avoid that. By the way, I should probably mention I'm a very small lady. 5'4"" and about 100 lbs. I have not had children. I've only had sex once in my life. 

My second issue is that the cup appears to make my already horrid, debilitating cramps worse and they last longer. I think on the second day, insertion began to get increasingly more painful each time, along with trying to fish the damn thing out of me. It felt like my vaginal walls were swollen, and it hurt so bad every time I put something in, even if it was just sliding a finger in to try to hook the rim of the cup to get it out. Eventually, I had to stop using the cup and go back to pads. After a day or maybe two, the swelling seemed to go down and I eventually went back to normal. My next cycle will be here in a couple weeks, and I want to give the cup another shot. Mostly because it was $30 and I don't wanna waste that. Just not sure if it's worth the pain. Maybe if there's nothing I can do about this, I'll either stop using it entirely or find a new cup. 

Anyone have any advice so that I'm not spending more time squatting in my bathroom, trembling, and gnashing my teeth in pain?

270,"I've been taking supplements for the past few weeks, as I've heard EPO is supposed to be great for your skin.

The past few weeks I've also had:

- Sudden, inexplicable nausea that starts right before or during eating, and fades after, even though I feel perfectly fine aside from that. I've had to throw up once or twice. (No, I am not pregnant.)

- My period starting earlier than it should. I'm on birth control pills and typically last 2-3 months before getting my period. It's been about a month and a half now.

- Sudden, intense cramps the first day of my period. Typically, I have occasional period cramps but not this bad or this frequent/long.

284,"Let's start from the beginning.

I was put on birth control (FemmeTab) at 15, due to irregular periods and becoming sexually active. I was on that for 4 years, and stopped due to increasingly bad mood swings and anger. I was off that for a few months, and got a period about twice for a few days.

Wanting to try something different, I got implanon put in and had that for 9 months. Of those 9 months, I bled every day apart from 2 weeks all up. Had that taken out because high risk of anemia and bleeding every day is a just plain nuisance.

4-5 months after having implanon out, I took a weeks dosage of Primolut as I hadnt had any bleeding at all. That made me bleed for 5 days.

About 5 months after that, I was referred to a gyno to have a check up. I had a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound done, in which all came clear (however, I'm not convinced). There was a black spot on my right kidney and my uteruses have many black spots.
I also had my hormones checked, they came back all normal.
My blood was testing for clotting ability (Vonwille brand factor, collagen assay, etc) that came back borderline. I have to redo.

She prescribed a dosage of primolut for 5 days and Levlen ED for 2 months.

Finished the primolut and started the first tablet of pill after 3 days. That made me bleed for 2 days. Currently on the 4th day of pill.

And here we are. I despise the oral pill as it doesnt fix the issue, just kind of puts a bandaid over it. I am going to take the pill for a month just to show the gyno that I trialled it. However, I do not want to take it in the long run.

Edit 6-20-2018 (44days after original post)

Called my doctor and got blood drawn to test for thyroid and general blood info.  Results were: my red blood cell count is normal but the ferritin (iron) level is low.  This means I'm not anemic but have low iron levels.  Instructions were to continue taking iron supplements until levels return to normal.

***Also I realized that the liquid iron supplement I was taking only had an iron content of 54% dv per each 10ml, whereas a different brand I tried recently had 100% dv for 10ml.  I definitely noticed increased energy and awareness taking the latter, and the price between the two is relatively equal, so I will definitely be switching.  The liquid iron supplement I'm taking is organic and plant-sourced if that helps.
Best of luck to anyone else experiencing this.  I've been taking the liquid iron twice daily which is crucial for maintaining energy throughout the day.  I take 15/20ml right when I wake up, on an empty stomach, and then 10mg before bed (which prevents me from waking up exhausted).  I've found this to be really helpful for me.

304,"I need some help, but I've been to multiple doctors almost every week for over 2 months, and can't find help. I need a new perspective so hopefully I can get some feedback here.

I have always hated my periods, as I'm told most young girls do, but it has always seemed more intense for me. I started my periods around 12 years old, and 7 years later they have never been regular, always heavy, and always giving me intense anxiety. This anxiety was so bad that between the ages of 12 to 16, I was afraid to not wear a pad, as I would sometimes have full heavy periods every other week. Menstruating has traumatized me for years. At 16 I tried birth control for the first time, and it only took a week on regular estrogen-containing birth control for me to become extremely emotional and stop taking them. My doctor then prescribed me a norethindrone birth control, which I took successfully for 2 years with no issue. My periods were manageable, lighter but still irregular, and though I wore liners between periods, some of the anxiety had subsided. Until one month I had two periods nearly back to back, only 2 days between them and fairly heavy again. So I went back to my doctor and they suggested the Depo Provera injection, which I was told would stop my periods all together, or some spotting would occur. I went one month period free and felt relieved, when suddenly I started spotting, which I expected.... but I did not expect to bleed every day for the next two month afterward. It was horrible, I went through so many pads and my anxiety of leaking through my clothes was a daily struggle. The worst symptom by far was the flare up of depression that occurred. I went into a doctor who referred me to a gynaecologist, and after waiting 2 months for an appointment to see what my options were for controlling my periods, I was treated like garbage by the gynaecologist, who attempted to sell me on an IUD (which often make periods worse, not something I'd gamble based on my history wit bc that isn't normally known for that), and eventually I let him prescribe me hormonal birth control pills so I could leave the office, which I threw away when I got home. I was also made extremely comfortable in the office, and am now afraid to see another gynaecologist in case of a similar result. I had blood taken by a doctor and my hormone levels while off birth control aren't abnormal, so it's a mystery as to why nothing is regulating my periods. But it seems like now I'm out of options. I've been represcribed the norethindrone, but it's been making me extremely emotional too, and I can't deal with having this mental health stress. I'm in a relationship, and I can't jeopardize my mental health and put that on my partner with something as stupid as birth control, but my crazy periods affect our sexual life too, and they give me anxiety which isn't good either. I want a hysterectomy so bad (we're both ladies so we're not having kids anyway, and I think babies are disgusting), but because I'm only 19 there's hardly a chance of that no matter how bad my situation gets. I've been told doctors won't do them if you don't have kids, at all (which is bs in my opinion). 

But since I'm sort of stuck with two bad options, would anyone know of some other advice for how to stop periods without birth control, or what to do next, any other kind of specialist I could see? I'm Canadian so health cost isn't usually an issue. 
Any advice is welcome (though I'm not interested in comments about my stance on kids or removing my uterus, I've heard every line and it makes no difference to me, I decided a long tome ago I wasn't having kids of my own, adopting after I've checked child-free things off my bucket list seems like a better idea for me).

While I washed my hands before inserting it, and my hands weren't terribly dirty beforehand, I still touched the tampon with my unwashed hands and I think it touched the bed as I was getting up to go to the bathroom. The one upside is, I doubt I'll be getting much sleep and I might still be awake in 4 hour's time.

323,"First, not sponsored. I've paid full price for all the of products I'm going to talk about.

Second, this will be TMI for some, but I am a medical professional and a no nonsense person about menstruation. I'm going to use words like vagina, clotting, hemorrhagic, and give in depth descriptions of my experience. This isn't meant to be offensive, just food for thought. If I've learned anything, it's that someone will go through this eventually and will need this info to make an educated decision.

Skip the next few paragraphs if you don't care about my reproductive stuff.

Suh, dude. I am an x chromosome, with fibroids, ovarian cysts, and hemorrhagic bleeding. I am 98% infertile and go to the ER for pain medications every few cycles because I physically can't walk during some mensies.

I burn through 4 super tampons on a regular flow day. I've had the best luck with pads, as they're more absorbent and less likely to leak all over my damn scrubs. In January 2018 I switched to reusable period products, because I was spending upwards of $40 per month to manage my period.

I bought a set of 5 bamboo reusable pads, and a set of standard/small menstrual cups. After their arrival (thanks amazon) I made an appointment with my GYN to get my mandatory yearly exam and ask if I was safe to use the menstrual cup. I do have a uterine IUD for birth control. After an ultrasound, pap, and exam I had the string trimmed and was given the ok to use the cup. I was also instructed to take 400 mg of ibuprofen two times a day every day I'm menstruating to lessen the flow. Consult your doctor about this before you try. Ibuprofen can fry your kidneys.

***Actual review now***

So the reusable pads need to be used a few times to reach maximum absorbency. The ones I picked were bamboo fiber. I wash all my clothes in biodegradable detergent and distilled white vinegar. DO NOT DRY WITH HEAT. I rinse with cold water and wring them out gently after use until the water is mostly clear. They go into a plastic zip bag until I have enough to wash (smells bad after a few days, I'm still working out the kinks) then hang dry in the bathroom when they're out if the washer. They dry within 24 hours. I can't reccomend reusable bamboo pads enough. They're not smelly and last most of the day if I use the bathroom often and do frequent cleaning of my perineal area (vagina). 

The cup was difficult to size, but after some trial and error I got the position right. Contrary to advertisment, if your heavy flow you'll want to empty it every time you use the bathroom. I take it out to have a bowel movement (poop) because it has slid down when I push. I'd highly reccomend wearing a pad during your first few uses, because getting a good seal is tricky.

To remove, bear down first. If you don't it will make an uncomfortable suction, even if the cup you choose has holes near the rim.

Since I am hemmoragic (I bleed a ton) using them over night doesn't work. I just go with pads to catch the ""drop"" when I stand up, the use the cup for the day time.

I know it's kind of a weird recommendation, but I use adult toy sanitizer to clean my cup after my cycle has finished. Most cups are made from silicone, and I only boil them when I first receive them. You don't have to have an adult toy to buy the sanitizer that's silicone safe. Just order it from Amazon or venture to an adult store (if you're over the age of consent) and pick up some. It's a life saver if you get frequent infections in your vagina. If you need a parents permission, just explain why you need it and hope for the best. If your parent or guardian doesn't consent *please boil your cup after every cycle*

***Do not use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to sanitize anything silicone***

I hope this helps someone. I will always be open to any PMs or comments regarding questions. Periods suck, and sometimes there isn't a safe place to talk about these things. Gynecology is sorely lacking in education, and every person with a vagina deserves to know what is going on down there.

*

I am a trans man. I've been on testosterone (T) for about six years. After my first injection, my period disappeared and it was glorious. Menstruation is one of the few things that triggers serious dysphoria in me and being able to just make it go away vastly improved my life.

Flash forward to October 2017: I notice I'm spotting enough that I need to go out and buy pads. My husband tells me to go to the doctor. I do, they draw blood, my numbers are normal. I am told to come back if it happens again. My husband, knowing I am very upset and dysphoric, promises we will figure this out together, even if it means I need a hysterectomy.

November 2017: My husband has fallen into a coma and I end up needing to call a friend for pads because I wasn't even thinking about my period and now I have a pile of toilet paper stuck in my boxers. This is 100% a period and lasts about 8 or 9 days. I don't do anything because I am literally living in the hospital (they have a shower in the basement).

December 2017: I get my period about 4 days after my husband dies. I go to CVS and get pads and mostly try to forget that it is Christmas or that happiness ever existed. 

January 2018: It... happens again. It's very heavy (5-6 overnight pads a day) for 12 days. I moved in with friends who had a spare room shortly after my husband died and when they realize, they tell me to go to the doctor.

The doctor is concerned. He draws blood again with the same results - I have normal testosterone levels and should not be menstruating. He orders a transvaginal ultrasound which... is a nightmare for me. But the results came back perfectly normal. The cramps are jaw droppingly awful and I am prescribed tramadol.

By the end of my period, I am getting contact dermatitis from using pads, which was a big problem before my transition, just because of how long the period is. I hie my ass down to Whole Foods and pick up a Lunette (size 1/25 ml), which was my menstrual cup of choice before T. Happily, using a menstrual cup is apparently like riding a bike.

February: And again. Using the Lunette, I have a roughly better idea of ml of blood. For the first four days, I have to change my cup 4 times a day and wear it with an overnight pad to sleep. The next 5 days I change it three times a day and can get through the night (I sleep about six hours). After that, until day 14, I change it twice a day. I am sent to an OBGYN who is trans knowledgeable.

I see the OBGYN who does not do a physical exam but orders more blood tests and tells me to go back to my GP. Blood tests, which look at my hormone landscape far more extensively, come back perfectly normal for a man my age and do not explain why I am menstruating. According to my blood profile, this should not be happening. I am also not anemic and do not have any apparent nutrition or vitamin deficiencies.

I have a seizure while walking home from work (first time). Over Facebook, an aunt lets me know that my paternal family has a history of hormone related grand mal seizures and my aunts/cousins have managed that with hormone replacement therapy. I am told I cannot take tramadol because it lowers seizure thresholds.

I see my neurologist who says he does not specialize in seizures, but orders an EEG and MRI. I have not yet done them because I am grieving in a very serious way and I just. cannot. handle. all. of. this. without. him. Literally, getting my period now isn't just a dysphoria trigger, it's a reminder that I am alone.

March: I started spotting yesterday, after a day of cramps that were so bad I literally couldn't get up from my desk at work. Today, by 1:30, I had changed my Lunette 3 times. I anticipate needing to change it at least 2 more times today before bed and will probably set an alarm to change it in the middle of the night. Passing small clots as well, blueberry/pea sized. 

I'm... an emotional mess right now and in pretty agonizing pain from the cramping that's been pretty unabated since Friday. I have a doctor's appointment (standing) next week, so I don't see a point in making another one and needing to take PTO for it when the situation literally hasn't changed. I don't think I am at the point where period has turned into hemorrhage (although I admittedly don't exactly remember the ml guidelines the nurse gave me, the clots aren't big enough). I am just so miserable and no one in the medical field seems to know what's going on or how to help.

*

From the beginning medical professionals have suggested that a total hysterectomy would obviously resolve this issue. In October, when I spoke to my husband about it, we decided it would be a final resort if it became a major unsolvable problem (we did not expect it to be). Right now, it really isn't on the table. I am not in a position any longer where major surgery/medical trauma/hospital settings like that are remotely palatable or non-traumatic. I have had to tell every single doctor this fact and I am getting tired of it.

350,"Hey :) First time posting here, but been looking for somewhere to discuss this issue. 

I've been using a menstrual cup for a few years now, and have found it nothing short of revolutionary. I personally use a Mooncup, in the smaller size. This is because I am under 30 and have not given birth. 

Over the last few months, however, I've experienced some problems. Some leaking, in ways I haven't had before. Usually my cup is only breached when I go on mega-flow (which happens, I have some issues), but recently even mildish flow can bid for freedom. 

Now, I've been wondering if this might be because I'm turning 30 in a few months, maybe I'm just naturally hitting the point where I need a new, ""over 30s"" cup. If that starts to look likely, I'm considering which brand to go with. I haven't had *issues* as such with my Mooncup, but I'm aware there are other brands and I'm open to them. I don't want anything non silicone, and wouldn't want to reduce the volume. (I'm in the UK, so looking at options I can get here). 

Alternatively I'm also considering adding in some cloth pads, so that I can add some backup when needed, and also for when I desperately need a break from internal menstrual wear (sometimes I have super lengthy menses, fun.)

So, sorry - TL;DR -

I'll tell you more about myself, and I'll be happy to clarify, or add any info that may help.

I'm 29 years old. I have never been on any sort of birth control. I have had two children, born in 2010 and 2012. Both pregnancies and births were full of complications. After the second birth, I had to have several surgeries to fix things, and then there were complications with the surgeries.

Since late 2014 or early 2015, I've experienced spotting between some of my periods. That is to say, I don't bleed between every period. Sometimes there will be 3-4 months when this doesn't happen at all, then there will be a few months when it does. The spotting is so light that I only have to wear a panty liner. Sometimes it's so light, I can get by with wearing nothing at all, and only see traces of blood when I use the bathroom. The blood is definitely coming from my vagina. This spotting can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple weeks. The longest it has ever lasted was exactly one month.

My periods are regular, with mild cramping, and last 4-7 days. They are never heavy, and I don't even experience PMS symptoms other than mild bloating.

Like I said, I've been to many different doctors about this problem. I've had all kinds of tests done, including blood work to look at my thyroid and hormones. All tests came back clear: there don't seem to be any abnormalities with my thyroid or hormones. I've had numerous pap smears and biopsies done, no problems there. I have never had any pre-cancerous or cancerous cells. There doesn't seem to be any history in my family with ''women's cancers''. I've had numerous ultrasounds of different kinds, and my doctors have all said that everything about my uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries look completely normal. I asked them if PCOS might be the cause of my bleeding, but they all agreed that I do not seem to have PCOS. I've been looked at for cysts, fibroids, etc, and none have ever been found. My uterine lining is not thick. I don't have any endometriosis. No polyps or cervical erosion.

I have not been sexually active in several years, but when I was sexually active, I did sometimes bleed a tiny bit after sex.

Sorry if TMI, but I masturbate on occasion. No penetration. Sometimes I get a bit of bloody discharge after orgasms.

I'm writing all this, because I've had many days of very light spotting and bloody discharge for the last two months. I also had a normal period last month that lasted maybe five days. I keep an account of every single day that I bleed, if anyone is interested. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm scared. I know most of you guys are probably not medical professionals, but if anyone has any idea as to what could be wrong with me, or has any suggestions, please say!

I have noticed that when I eat cleaner, when I take all processed sugar out of my diet, I bleed less often. These days of spotting started up again after I reintroduced sugar to my diet after being off it for several weeks.",Help! What could be wrong with me?,0
356,"hi ladies, so this months period has been weird for me.
I had been waiting for this months period because I thought I could've been pregnant. A week ago I had spotting w some cramps, I thought maybe it was implantation bleeding but still decided to wait to take a test until i missed my period. A week passed i was feeling very nauseous, my lower back was hurting, and last night when I went to the rest room when I wiped it was light pink gooey blood (i thought it was vaginal mucus, never had that light of blood) I put on a pad in case it was my period but when I woke up there was nothing on the pad went to pee and when i wiped it was all gooey blood not much either left to class when i decided to check again to see if i needed a pad change there was just a small amount of dried blood but for the most part it was clean. Something when I wiped it was gooey and light. When i got home I was soo tired I decided to take a nap i woke up with cramps on just the left side nothing unbearable but I just never had that either. Just want to know if this is normal since i have never experienced this. (just checked and pad is still clean) ",gooey period,0
357,"Hi,

So I'm kind of mildly concerned about my super irregular menstrual cycle and I'm not sure if I should be worried or not. Okay context is, basically before this I haven't had my period in months. I started working like around March last year and I noticed around August (?) that I haven't been getting my period and since I don't really have the money to get checked, I just assumed it was because I was overweight (which I really am tho tbh like not mildly overweight but kinda super overweight). So okay I started going to the gym and everything and it's working out fine (like am losing a normal amount of weight) and I assumed it's all good cus I got my regular period back in like November and December. Now, I got my regular period in around mid January but now, I'm still sort of having my period? Like when I think it's over, I notice that one day I'm bleeding again then it's gone the next day and it's happening for like a few weeks now. It's not really like heavy bleeding but it's more like those light periods like during the end of your cycle, yknow? And it's like I'm kinda bothered by it cus I don't know when to expect it and maybe there's legitimately something wrong but I dont wanna make a big deal out of it if it's just nothing yknow?

358,"At 25, my PMS has progressed to the point of affecting my ability to operate effectively at my job and in my interpersonal relationships for 3 days out of the month. I become an overly emotional, tense, anxious mess that is incapable of critical thought, clear communication, and operating under stress - all of which is required from me to succeed at my career. 

I told my doc today at my yearly physical, and he prescribed me low dose Naltrexone. I honestly had no clue there was medication that could be prescribed to help PMS. I am already on Wellbutrin and Xanax for anxiety and depression. My PCP said the Naltrexone should not only improve PMS mood swings, but also help my overall anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm really looking forward to trying this so I no longer turn into a raging irrational monster towards every person I love and care about on a monthly basis. 

Interestingly, Naltrexone is used for a wide range of ailments from helping curb opioid addiction to helping address infertility.

359,"I'm a 29 year old woman. I've had two children, the last in 2012. Since 2014-2015 I have been experiencing spotting between my periods. This doesn't occur every month - sometimes I experience this problem every other month, and sometimes there will be 3-4 months in which it doesn't happen. Rarely, there will be a couple months in a row in which this happens, so the spotting is an irregular occurrence.

The spotting usually begins 9-12 days after I've ended my last period. My periods are always normal and pretty regular, lasting no more than 7 days, with manageable cramping. I never cramp when I get this spotting. The spotting usually lasts no more than 3 days, but sometimes it lasts for one to two weeks. Once, it lasted exactly one month! Light spotting, sometimes so light that I only see it when I wipe.

I've been to multiple doctors and gynaecologists about this problem over the years. I've had basically every sort of exam they could possibly do on me over and over again - transvaginal ultrasounds, other ultrasounds, pap smears, really anything you can think of. No one can figure out what is causing me to have this bleeding. It's been confirmed over and over again, by multiple doctors, that I have no cysts. No fibroids. No endometriosis. No polyps. Definitely no PCOS. No hyperplasia. Nothing, nothing at all. They tell me my cervix seems completely healthy. No abrasions, erosion, etc. No precancerous cells. I've also had biopsies of my uterus, which all came back normal.

I haven't been sexually active in years, if that makes any difference. I get regular gynaecological checkups and pap smears, all of which are always normal. I have noticed that this bleeding tends to happen when I have more sugar in my diet. That is to say, during the times when I reduce the sugar in my diet to literally nothing but fresh fruit, this problem never happens at all, so maybe it's related to sugar?

So far, no doctors have been able to find out why I spot like this. I've never been on any sort of birth control, no pills, implantations, nothing. So far, I've only been told that the problem could be ovulation bleeding, but who experiences ovulation bleeding for two weeks at a time?

I'm making this post because I'm spotting again, very lightly. This time it's lasted for about five days. I always keep a detailed account of all my periods and everything, if that makes any difference.

Despite all the reassurances from doctors, I'm worried. What could possibly be wrong with me?

377,"So shark week is coming up, and I've always had a certain fit issue with pads, and I was wondering if any of you had the same experience.

Please also keep in mind that I cannot use tampons. I've tried every brand, style, and insertion technique, and there is nothing going on medically that prevents me from wearing tampons. I just can't.

Anyway, I tend to use Always or Always Infinity pads, and their wings never wrap properly around my panties. It's hard to explain, but the wings are so ""tall"" (wide from short end to short end) that there's too much material to fold over. So a lot of the wings end up inside my underwear, and i just have to scrunch the rest of it around/attempt to fold the wings over as best I can. So the wings are always too big, and the pad itself is too narrow. I guess I wear the wrong style of panties or something, because the pads never seem to quite work with my panties or the leg openings. I once resorted to trimming the wings with scissors so they'd fit better.

I guess the *style* of underwear that I wear is an issue?I avoid bikinis or multipack briefs, because those styles dont work with my build/shape, and I prefer the fabric go around my rear, not across it. if I have to deal with shark week, I'm going to be comfortable. So I tend to go with something more like [this](https://www.onehanesplace.com/shop/onehanesplace/panties/panty-brands/bali-panty/bali-nylon-panties-262100).

I do have to have wings, because my pads shift enough as it is, no matter how often I change them. My roommate mentioned a different brand that doesn't have the fit issue, but I can't remember what brand it was. Stayfree, maybe?

So a little background. I am overweight but I've been making a big lifestyle change in what I eat and how I live. My period has been making stuttering starts and then stopping, compared to not getting it at all. So the cup was really just a precaution after a leak I had only an hour before.

The day he went home I noticed some pinkish colored blood on the toilet paper when I went to the bathroom, which I thought might just be from chafing or something. I had that for about a day or two. Then my period started, and I have a paraguard IUD so typically I have cramping a day or two before my period starts, it lasts for about 5 days and it gets really heavy the second and third days then lightens up afterwards.

In 2011 it switched to going months without a period, even though I had never taken birth control. In 2014 it switched to periods lasting 2-4 months at a time. In 2015 it normalized back down to the random 30-60 day cycle. Now I've been on my period for 7+ months.

I had weight loss surgery and my period started a few days after, which is common because fat stores estrogen so my body was releasing all these extra hormones, and it hasn't stopped since.

The night that it started, it was unusually painful, but it wasn't from cramps. It was this slow, burning pain that I've never felt before, and it quickly turned to nausea. I've had period pain before, but not like that. It kept me up all night, and I got no sleep at all. The pain continued well into the afternoon, and only started to ease off literally *hours* after I took a Tramadol (prescription opiate). 

The next day, I got up and took my daily shower. When I started washing myself, I noticed the most *ungodly* smell. Menstrual blood does smell bad to a point, and I know this. But I was actually appalled by the stench that was emanating from me. It smelled like literal rotten flesh. This makes no sense, as I am a hygienic person.

When I started getting my period I was 12 and 110lbs. It was always regular and lasted 5 days. I would get **horrible** cramps the day before I started bleeding but the doctor said there was nothing wrong with me and suggested birth control to reduce the cramps.  It worked like a charm, and when I decided to have kids I got pregnant in one cycle and didn't have to deal with the cramps. So it was years of very light or no period, and no PMS, thanks to birth control, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. 

7.5 years ago I got a (Mirena) IUD and that stopped my periods. My weight fluctuated over the years but the heaviest I had been by that point was 130lbs. But I had to have it (well the second one) removed 6 months ago and can not be on hormonal birth control anymore. During the ~7 years I had an IUD, I gained weight and now I am 230lbs.

I know that being overweight makes your period heavier but how do I know if it's TOO heavy? It just seems like a crazy amount and crazy long? It is going 9 days - 3 days light/building up, 3 days very heavy and painful, 3 days tapering off/light. It is regular, starting every 28 days. PMS is quite reliably starting 7 days before the period starts. This means that for *over half* the month, I am miserable! Is this just how it is, getting a period while overweight? Or do you think it'll even out after more time without the IUD? Can anything be done, if I can't use hormones to control my period?",Is this my life now?,0

- Ate a little too much? Cramps. Didn't eat enough? Cramps. Seriously, planning out my eating schedule and *what* I can eat during the first few days of my periods can be a nightmare. There are days where if I don't eat within the first 30 or so mins of waking up, I will have pretty much guaranteed I'll start cramping. 

- Sudden feelings of nausea and fatigue. Every once in a while, everything will be just fine. Tons of energy, and zero cramps and then with the flip of a switch, I'll be overcome with the most extreme fatigue, and if my period really wants to make it's presence known, that fatigue will be accompanied by nausea and cramps.  

- 9 times out of 10, my menstrual cup goes in and stays in without a hitch. Last night was that 1 in 10. I woke up around 4 in the morning and it felt like my body was trying to reject my menstrual cup. I got up, took it out, switched to a pad, and took an Advil. Although that provided some relief from the cramps, it took about half an hour for them to subside enough so that I could fall back asleep. 

- A few months ago, I went to see a movie. Knowing that it was going to be long, and that I was on my period, I limited the amount of liquid I drank beforehand, and went to the bathroom before the movie started. I was good up until the last 45 or so mins of the movie when that feeling that I needed to use the bathroom started to hit me. I managed to wait until the movie was done (I'm really stubborn about getting up during movies) and then hauled ass out of the theatre so I could get to a toilet and urinated for what felt like days. It was then that I learned whatever position my menstrual cup was in has the potential to prevent me from fully relieving myself, and that I had pretty started watching the movie with an already half full bladder.

Before this year I had never experienced having a period early. In the past 8-9 months, I've been pretty late and extremely early.... even having my period twice in one month. Also, I my periods have been shorter.... at first I attributed this to the fact that I'm turning 30 soon and just thought that maybe my body (and therefore my  PMS symptoms/ periods) were changing again, as they have every 5 or so years since I've been menstruating.

Just found this sub and am hoping for some insight or advice. After a fair amount of Googling and even talking with the women's health nurse practitioner at my university health service yesterday, I still haven't found an explanation or good leads...

Some facts:
-31 year old female, smoker, have been on hormonal oral bc since I was 17, with a couple years of gap around age 25-27.
-Since restarting after the gap, my periods were erratic. Other health issues going on, which included malnutrition and weight loss. Would miss some months, sometimes bleed 2x a month.
-Period stabilized finally for a bit June - November 2016 when I switched to Junel Fe, but during this time I noticed the low fever every month just before and during the first few days of bleeding. My temp runs around 97.9 normally, and during those times it would go up to 100 (but not more... usually around 99.1, just enough to feel a little extra shitty).
-In November I had a major surgery (removed part of my pancreas) and stopped bc while in hospital. Restarted same bc the following month, no period in december. Then since January have had my ""real"" period (heavy flow, some cramps, the fever) during the 2nd week of the pack, with a little spotting (no fever) during the 4th placebo week.
-In January, I had an MRI to follow up on the surgery. Everything related to gastro stuff looked fine, but the techs noted a bonus: a possible cyst on my left ovary.
-I am going to be switching bc next month, and am scheduling a follow-up ultrasound to check out the possible cyst. But the nurse practitioner yesterday didn't think either were necessarily causing the fever (and didn't seem concerned about the maybe-cyst).
-This past weekend, the fever was higher than usual. Even after taking advil AND tylenol, my temp stayed at 99.3 (before it would at least go down to 98.something after taking an anti-inflammatory).

I've been fortunate enough to find myself a member of a group working on a few really cool projects, and we could use as much help from the community as possible.

In a nut shell, we've built a back-end system that efficiently scrapes, organizes, and displays every piece of information available on the internet. If you're a techy, you can image the mass implementation with things like blockchain or even the stock market.

However, our goal is to keep the platform free, and to use it as a layer to build apps on top of. We've been fortunate enough to get approached by a few professors or health care professionals about building apps that better help teens with depression, diabetes, menstruation cycles, and other complications as such.

What I'm here for is to get some advice on some mind blowing additions you could see being added to diabetes apps? Yes, I've done my reading online and checked out what people are saying about each app, however, I'd like you to keep in mind that we've built a deep-learning machine AI that is capable of virtually anything, so feel free to get a little sci-fi on me.

From the looks of it so far, most apps simply: 
-Track and map your ovulation cycle, etc
-Let you input your exercise levels, foods, moods, journal entries, etc 
-Remind you when it's time to change tampons
-Suggest if you need to contact a healthcare professional
-Display your information in some creative manner while educating you on your results 
-Connect you to a community to share your story and find stories of others
This is all cool, but would talk only about 2 days to create an API for our AI. We have the budget to really blow people's nips off, so help toss out some great ideas. If you're interested in being on the team (none of us get paid though, just a heads up), shoot me a line as well and we can chat!

542,"Hello everybody! This is my first time in this sub so bear with me...

I'm a 21-year-old college student currently taking Microgestin FE. I should note that I am slightly underweight and don't usually get my period. I've had a really weird last week and a half, bleeding-wise. 

After 6-7 months of no periods, I started my period about 10 days ago, with no blood, just tissue/membrane/uterine lining/whatever it is (sorry) and very very little brown/dark brown discharge. My cramps were light to moderate. All that stopped for 3 days, then started back up yesterday. Since then, I've still been shedding uterine lining, with horrible cramps and pain in my lower back that radiates down my legs. I have a little blood, but not like a regular period. 

Mainly what I'm concerned about is the shedding of lining. I've had this before, but not for the whole period. Is this normal? I've looked up the symptoms and google gave me 'pregnancy'. As I said before, i am on the pill, and am fairly good about not missing days. Any help is appreciated.

545,"Hey all!

I have a question about aches! 

Ever since I can remember, I get dull, constant aching on the first day of my period. The aching starts in my lower back (though feels more internal than just my lower back), and if I don't attack it with pain killers or a hot water bottle/heat pack, it will travel down my legs: upper thighs then lower things etc. and I just wondered if anyone else experiences this?

Years ago I used to take 2 x paracetamol tablets and the aching would disappear. After a while I had to switch to ibuprofen as paracetamol was no longer effective, and then it got to the point where I'd have to take ibuprofen twice, maybe even three times because the aching would reappear in the evening or the next day. These days, painkillers are my last resort as I became sick of taking them so frequently. I generally use a hot water bottle or heat pack, which works perfectly (and still I may have to use it a few times when the aching re-appears).

I've always assumed this was normal. I mentioned it to my osteopath a while back and she said it didn't seem normal. Now of course she isn't a doctor trained in menstruation, but it got me thinking.

546,"Hey all, first time posting here. 

I am on BC pills, Marvelon to be exact. Have been for a couple of years. 

Usually, when I run out of my pills it takes almost exactly 2 days (without fail) for my period to start. 

I have been out of my pills now expecting my period and it's been 6 days today... just had intercourse with my BF this morning and immediately after (as in I was wiping his cum off of me and I wiped off blood) I started bleeding. I took this as a good sign. 

Well that was this morning, I changed my tampon at around noon, it was red, all that good stuff. 

It's been a couple hours so I went to change it again, it's almost completely dry with a few spots of very light brown on it. 

Usually I will get the brown ""old"" blood at the very end of my period, but I have never heard of it at the beginning before? Especially after this morning it was a medium flow, then all of the sudden stops?! 

I'm just wondering if this is normal, if it happens to anyone else... maybe I'm just overreacting... have had too many scares for someone who religiously takes their BC. 

I am just freaking out because I have heard brown spotting at the beginning can actually be implantation bleeding.

547,"Hey all!

On sharkweek day 2 and having some unpleasant stuff I haven't experienced before. Last night I was woken up by a weird emotional state and cramps.

I would describe the feeling a little bit like that heart sink sensation when you realize you've accidentally said/done something that will have horrible consequences mixed with fingernails on a chalkboard and the frustration of something being not quite symmetrical. Basically autistic mind-hell. As I was waking up my brain was flashing hard-to-describe images of sharp things being covered in very soft rounded material (a common synesthetic representation I have for a feeling of extreme discomfort).

It wasn't related to the dream I was having. Pretty sure it was a normal, pleasant dream. I was having a nice time sleeping when my mind decided it was suffer time. I eventually got up and took a bath.

The bath helped somewhat but the cramps were still preventing me from sleeping so I took a tylenol (one is usually enough). I ended up taking another tylenol and a shot of apple cider vinegar because I'd had a lot of pasta for dinner which sometimes gives me acid reflux (and I weirdly like drinking straight apple cider vinegar, don't judge me it's good for you.. I think). The hot bath made me realize I was thirsty so I had a glass of water. 

The vinegar, surprisingly, ended up helping because the burning sensation in my throat and stomach distracted me from the slow burning physical and emotional pain. The tylenol eventually put me to sleep and I slept the rest of the night through.

Today I was somewhat sensitive and thought about crying a couple times, cramps were mild and average, all routine stuff. Right now I feel somewhat emotionally uncomfortable again and I'm afraid it's coming back.

I am autistic. I experience sensory issues very mildly and occasionally. They will often worsen during period and PMS but this is something completely different. I also have (mostly associative) synesthesia which may be affecting my experience in some way.

**Other possible contributing factors:**

1. I had pasta with questionable tomato sauce for dinner. Psychoactive tomato sauce mold? It tasted fine.

2. I probably ate a little more than I should have because I hadn't eaten anything all day (forgot) and was really hungry.

3. I'm getting over a cold.

4. It's hot in my room and I may have been dehydrated from eating all that pasta.

5. Period is heavier than usual and had coffee ground looking stuff in it.


**TL;DR: I randomly woke up in the middle of the night in autistic brain hell and had to sedate myself with pain killers and apple cider vinegar.**

An example of this would be yesterday. It was about 12 hours into the first day of period and I don't think I took an ibuprofen in time. Cramps really started to hit me. 25-30 minutes into cramping, I'm laying in bed moaning from pain when I get this weird thought that I am needed and that I must get up immediately and go help someone move something like furniture or a box. No one is in my house and there was no sound, so I know it wasn't influenced by anything else like a TV. I just had a thought. I got up, walked out of my room before snapping out of it and going back to lay down in my bed. I've had similar weird thoughts during painful times in the past.

586,"So yesterday, I have no idea why, and it might be too gross for some of you but I have to ask someone. I got my period yesterday (I'm 21) and everything seemed normal at first, but then the pain just kept getting worse and worse even after taking 2 Amphetamines to ease the pain, but they did not work. Went into the bathroom and did no. 2 mostly, and I began feeling nauseous. Eventually threw up and had runny diarrhea. Now usually after you throw up you're supposed to feel better, but not exactly in my case. My stomach still felt upset and whenever I would try to ""push"" down there, it would just make me feel sick and like I had to throw up again. So I could not defecate because it cause me to vomit. I took more pills to ease the pain and eventually threw them up. 

My body would not stop shaking even though it was fairly warm, you could almost say I was convulsing, had a hard time standing up and walking. I really felt like calling 911 but was also in too much pain to do much anything than sit on the toilet, and it hurt just to breathe, I didn't want to imagine talking to someone. This happened to me once before, 1-3 months ago, I can't remember exactly when. It had while I was on my period as well. Fortunately my mom was home with me then and helped me through it, but she was not home this time, so I had to suffer all of 3 hours straight until the pain stopped and I took some meds to make me drowsy and I didn't throw those up.

Anyone know what this could be? I have iron-deficiency anemia if that makes a difference but I stopped taking medicine for it. This has been the worst pain I have ever experienced. I really felt like I was going to die.","Severe cramping, shaking, diarrhea? Why?",0
587,"For lack of understanding how to better explain, it really seems as if I had a period, it just never flowed out of me.

I'm on nuva ring and have been since I was 17 (I'm 27 now). I haven't had any inconsistencies with my dosages in over half a year or more and have only missed a period once before (like two or three years ago, and I decided it was stress related, period eventually came late). 

Anyways, I took out the ring for the week for my period but never had a period, so I just put it in per usual.

I have taken a pregnancy test and that came up no-babies.

So then I was masturbating a few days later after putting the new nuva ring in, thinking i'm in the clear, and having strong orgasms, but later (like half an hour or so?) when I go to the bathroom and wipe, there's bright red blood from my vagina.

So I wore a pad the rest of the day (and actually most of the rest of that week) and never had any blood or other period-like discharge all week. So then now just over another half a week later I masturbate again and now, several hours later, I see that dark brown sticky staining on my underwear that I typically see late in my cycle (which I presume to be dried blood mixed with general vag. mucus).

Am I ok? I know y'all are not medical professionals, and I plan to contact my gyno on the next business day, but just wondering if this is something I should be worrying about or not.

I know this can happen on my pill, so I wasn't concerned. It lasted 5 days, just as my periods always have.

However, 9 days later and I am bleeding again. This time it feels much more like my typical periods before I began this pill. Yesterday it was light, thin brown when I wiped and a little in my underwear. Today it was thicker and darker, but after that it has gone back to being fairly thin and brown/reddish-brown.

Anyway, she was taking Fildess birth control 1.5/30 and we randomly picked up her prescription, and they either got bought out or it got miss-filed, and we received Lupin 1.5/30.  She did as standard, wait the 7 day period between the pills and had a heavy period which she has had recently, but when she started taking the new pills after the placebos, her period has not stopped.  It got light and then got extremely heavy again.

Is this expected to continue?  Is this just a standard issue when changing brands?  This has now happened twice to us and last time the only thing that helped was completely abstaining from all birth control for 3 months before restarting, which we really are not wanting to do again.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced similar or maybe is in the medical field and can suggest something. I am 37 and have been on b.c since about 16. Originally went on it for very painful and irregular periods. I stayed on it basically up until now. Was on combined oral pill for many years, then changed to Nuva Ring (which I really liked) for about 6 years, but on mentioning one day to my Dr that I get occasional aura migraines I was promptly taken off it.
I was off it for 6 months and my periods returned to being painful and lasting between 6 - 10 days each month. I thought it was just my body adjusting and the few months of 6 day periods meant I didn't mind overly about the few that lasted 10 days. The I met my boyfriend I decided I would try Implanon. Had it put in February 2015. For the first year it was pretty good, occasional periods that were light and didn't last long, but then February this year I started bleeding for about 3 weeks and then one week off, then a week bleeding, 2 weeks off, bleeding etc etc etc. I also felt it was really contributing to increased anxiety so decided to come off it.
Had the Implanon implant removed beginning of June 2016 (was just on last day of a bleed). I went for 2 weeks no bleeding and then got my period. It lasted for 11 days. I now seem to be in this pattern of having a 27 - 28 day cycle but start with 7 days of light, brown bleeding followed by 4 or 5 days of bright red, heavier bleeding. It seems as though this is when my period 'really' starts. I get sore boobs and cramps at this point.
I went to my doctor and have had blood tests to check hormone levels and thyroid function and also had an inter-vaginal scan. All results came back as 'normal'. So my options now seem to be, deal with a 2 week long period, go on Progestin only BC (don't really want to) or risk finding a doc to prescribe Nuva Ring again and risk increased chance of stroke.
I am quite happy not being on the pill, but how can I shorten my periods?? Or could my body still be adjusting from implanon? Seems weird my cycle is essentially normal (28 days) though. Would think I'd have 'irregular' periods as opposed to just long ones.

I would say the vomiting happens only 50% of the time, but each period that it does it seems to be worse.

I was on the pill at first, but was too active to remember to take it consistently. Eventually I was put on the patch, which fit my busy life a lot better.

629,"Hi r/menstruation - so glad to find you here - 

I um.. have had ongoing stomach problems, where I'm absurdly, debilitatingly nauseous for about 3 days, to the point where I need to be sedated in the ER because I just wanna throw myself into a wall until I die so it stops. 

Well, about a month ago, I had an attack of that towards the middle of my period, and my period stopped cold - just stopped - til I got better a few days later, when I spotted for a day, and then it came back full force. Aaand has not stopped since then. I haven't had as bad an experience of this month long period as I do usually of a week-long period, I've had fewer cramps, less bloating, and all, I'm assuming, because this is the longest period of all time, and my uterus is done trying.

But, I'd really like to have some non-goopy sex, and I have a vacation coming up, and I'm fresh out of ideas. I've had a recent std panel, a billion pregnancy tests because they do them whenever you go to the ER for anything apparently, and have been eating nothing but chicken soup with stars for 14 days.

631,"Hi!

So, about 7 years ago, at the ripe ole age of 19, I had the roughest weekend of my life. On Friday, I went to a party and when my boyfriend didn't come home, I stayed up all night anxiously thinking he was cheating on me. Early Saturday morning, my theory was confirmed. From Saturday morning to Sunday night, I cried my eyes out. I barely left my room. When I did leave my room, I continued crying and quickly asked to be helped back into bed.

It was bananas.

That Monday, I was walking to my on-campus job when I suddenly felt like I peed myself. Thank GOD I had one of those plaid tunic things on, because it totally masked the fact that had experienced an incredible rush of bleeding. I immediately turned and went back to my apartment, stripped, showered, and spent the rest of the day laying in bed. I had to change myself about every hour or so (I don't remember if it was tampons or pads-- probably tampons), and had a difficult time showering because it was just *that* bad.

I figured my heightened anxiety/emotions were the cause of the heavier period and moved on. 

It has never ever happened since then. But I'm wondering if that experience is something that I should be concerned about? I'm particularly concerned about future fertility? I know I should consult a doctor, but it's 12:44am and I was wondering if anyone else has had any experience with a similar problem.

637,"Hello! So a bit of background here: I'm 21 years old. I got on the depo shot when I was 18 (ladies please, don't ever do that. it was so super hellish). I got off the depo last October and switched to a 28-day BC pill (Trinessa). I've taken it religiously, aside from occasional instances where I go out of town and miss a day or two because I left it at home. I am also sexually active and there's a history of endometriosis on my mother's side of the family, and I also have anxiety/depression which I'm medicated for (150mg Zoloft). 

The depo eradicated my period, so I've just now gotten to a ~regular~ on/off cycle these past few months. My periods are about 5-6 days with a 22/23 day break.

As mentioned above I have missed the occasional pill, but I always follow the packet afterwards and follow directions depending on what week I was on. This last time I missed a pill was in either my 3rd or 4th week at the end of June. I had my regular cycle at the beginning of the month, but my next cycle came just 16 days later and lasted for 10 days straight. My flow was so heavy I was going through super+ tampons in 2-3 hours. My cramps were unbearable and I kept having dizzy spells (I assume from the blood loss).

So now, I'm 8 days late. I guess? My period was projected to start on the 18th, but I'm not sure when I'm supposed to start anymore. And it's already been 25 days since that 10-day cycle ended. I would think I'm not the only person on here who has experienced this. Is my body just regulating itself or should I be concerned?

638,"Hey all! Throwaway cause this is a bit embarrassing, lol.

Some background, I'm almost 17, started my period when I was 11, and overweight (which is something I've actively working on this summer, realized that this is not how I want to live my life). I used to take birth control, which I got on to originally stabilize my moods, but now that I've been doing well for over a year it's something I don't want to take and haven't taken for ~6 months. I can afford not to take it now, since I am not sexually active/and am a virgin, and don't plan on being active for a while when I focus on schooling (besides some masturbation, though if I do become sexually active I'll probably meet up with my doctor again and start taking them once again).

Anyways (sorry, this all is a bit gross), I had a really light period last month, to the point that I barely remember it. It lasted around 3-4 days, which I wasn't overly concerned about since I'm obese (irregular periods seems to be more common for those obese). 

This month, however, has been a bit crazy. I started bleeding lightly around the 6th of this month, and resumed to lightly bleed for ~6 days after that, which sounds pretty normal. After that week, though, I started to bleed a bit heavier, and my flow has gotten heavy enough that I'll bleed through a tampon if I don't change it at least every 4 hours. I've had heavy flows before, but this is kind of more then I'm used to. I've had some very noticeable menstrual clots, like one about the size of a dime yesterday and one slightly smaller then a quarter today. I've had a pretty nasty cold all week so I really haven't been paying as much attention as I should be.

Given the fact that I've been on my period for 15 days now, and that my flow is heavy, I'm wondering what I should do. Is my body playing catchup from last month?

I freaked out because we had sex the day before I started and then like 2 weeks before that and my period started with a heavy flow for about 2 and a half days, and then bounced between no flow and a normal flow for 3 days. it also only last 5 days when my periods usually last for 6-7.

I had a colposcopy on May 4th (he sprayed vinegar and took a sample), and had sex on May 8th.  I had a little brown discharge on May 5th and 6th. 

I am still on BC and didn't use a condom on the 8th. 


The Doctor didn't tell me anything about refraining from sex or if there would be spotting. He just left and said to make a consultation appointment. Which left me with a lot of questions and feeling kinda shitty. 


My last period was on the 20th of April. 


On May 8, I was supposed to start a new pill pack, I think, and I am pretty sure I missed the pill. I started on Monday and realized ""Huh, I guess I missed Sunday"" as I usually start on Sunday's. I didn't take the Sunday pill because I thought ""well maybe the dates just aren't lining up since I am missing the 7 day break. Since I'm taking it back to back.""  Which isn't true I guess. 

Anyway, now it's the 14th and earlier this week my nipples were so sensitive! Maybe for two days they were tender. 

I felt a light cramping feeling on and off randomly. I felt tired and dizzy randomly and sometimes a gross sick feeling a night. Could be food related, but I doubt it. I've been eating well. 

I really do not want to be pregnant and would be extremely surprised if that's the case. 

Could all this be from missing one pill? I take a light hormonal dose.

* Pregnancy, implantation, or pregnancy-related issues  
* Birth control  
* PID  
* Menstruation  
* Masturbating a lot on a short time span 
* Sexual arousal   

But there is no way I'm pregnant. I have had many normal periods since I last did anything, which has been awhile (more than 6 months ago). I'm not on any kind of birth control, and I don't have PID. There is no pain anywhere down there at all - not even in any part of my stomach - and there is no foul odor down there or in the discharge itself. The odor only has a very faint, natural smell. I finished my period a few weeks back, and I am not due for one any time soon. And my self-love habits have not changed or increased or anything. I also was not aroused when I found the discharge. And I have never had this kind of discharge happen before.

Anyway, [here](http://imgur.com/Qe1JbWm) is the photo. **WARNING:** very gross and very NSFW. Also, the photo doesn't truly show how much is there.

676,"Hi, I changed my birth control pills from ones suitable for breastfeeding (desogestrel), let's call them A, to the ones I was using previously (drospirenone+ethinyl estradiol) let's call them B

**TLDR** Switched from A to B, had sex in between, and I'm not having my period; now I don't know if I'm pregnant, starting to have a fertility problem or it's just normal and my cycle will stabilize

**Wall of text**

I did the change because I had to wean my then 1y9mo old baby.  
When I consulted my gyn about the A pills, she told me that they were not that effective since I started complementary feeding my son, but also that I should be using those as long as I was nursing him. These are 28 active pills (I give this info because I live in another country and I dont know if you have the same as we do)

Now, when I was prescribed the B pills, my gyn told me that I could start taking them right away so I did.  
I finished them all including the 7 inactive ones (there are 21 active and 7 inactive).  
Before getting pregnant, when I took these pills, I was having my period at let's say the half of the inactive pills. But now, I'm having my second blister, I've already taken 7 new active ones, and my period doesn't come.

A couple things I've noticed: When I started the B pills I had mood swings, vaginal discharges -all things that seemed very normal as they were the same that I had before.
I still have all of these. Sometimes I want to cry without reason, and have cramps. Mostly in the ovaries area. But period doesn't show up.

A thing that confuses me is that, between weaning my baby and started the B pills, I had sexual intercourse (still taking A pills knowing that they wouldn't be effective anymore)

I'm starting getting super anxious so here are the questions:

- Is it normal that I don't have my period after changing the birth control formula I'm taking?

- Considering the last paragraph, may I be pregnant again? (when I got pregnant the first time I had cramps but in the uterus area, this time is the ovaries)

- Will I have a fertility problem because of this change? This worries me a lot because I have all the intention of trying for another baby next year.

(I'm already taking this option -&gt; give my period one more week, if it doesnt show up do pregnancy test; if pregnant I know the answer, if not, call my gyn --- but as I said I'm super anxious and this is counterproductive)

It seems like my period is playing hide and seek almost. For the past two weeks or so, I've been bleeding on and off, but whether or not I'm bleeding seems to coincide with whether or not I have my cup in. As soon as I start bleeding, I put it in, but once it's in the bleeding stops completely. Like, not a single drop of blood. I'll go through the motions of using the cup for about two days (regularly checking for blood and rinsing it every 5-6 hours). Then, I'll just give up, take it out, and put it away after cleaning it. Every single time I do this (this has happened about 3 times now), I'll start bleeding again a day later. Not light spotting, either, but the full gore of a normal (though slightly heavy) period. 

Three pairs of pants have so far fallen victim to this weird bleeding pattern because I kept simply thinking my period had just ended only to be surprised by more blood. It's frustrating because I feel like my uterus knows when my cup is in and is just refusing to bleed while its there out of spite. Of course, I know that this is probably not the case, but it's just too strange and irritating to ignore anymore. Has anyone else ever experienced this while using their menstrual cup? My only guess is that maybe the suction is messing with the blood's ability to descend or something, but if that were the case then wouldn't everyone have an issue with cups?

Have any of you had a similar experience?


LONG VERSION:
For starters I'm sorry for the wall of text ahead, and thank you ahead of time if you actually read it. :D

So at the beginning of 2013 I hadn't had a period in over 2 months so I went to a womens clinic for a pregnancy test, it came back negative and they told me it was probably just stress or something and that if I still hadn't started in 2 weeks, to come back for another one in case I WAS pregnant and just not producing the hormones yet. So I waited about 3 weeks and went back for another test, also was negative. 

The woman there suggested I see a doctor to get an exam and some blood work to try and find a cause for my missed cycles. I took her advice and went to a health clinic a few weeks later, they sent me to the hospital for blood work and two weeks later they called me back in with no clue what the cause was. They said there was nothing in my blood work to explain it and that it's perfectly normal to miss a period from time to time. 

I reminded her that it had now been over 4 months since my last cycle, she then prescribed me some medicine to ""jump start"" my cycle. And warned me that the first cycle was likely going to be much heavier than my normal and not to be alarmed if there were more clots than I was used to. I wasn't exactly happy with this, because it felt like treating the symptoms without knowing the cause, which I don't agree with, but I took the medicine like instructed anyways. 

That's when all hell broke loose, the first period was indeed much worse than I was used to, then again I didn't think much of it since I had been told ahead of time. It lasted about 2 weeks, I was going through 2 pads (layered over eachother) and an ultra tampon every hour, and passing huge clots. I didn't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time because I'd wake up covered in blood. The cramping was horrendous but I just kept telling myself it'd be fine, it was just like having 4 months of periods at once, and the next one would be back to normal.

Well I was wrong, two weeks after that one had stopped I started again, and it was just as bad. It continued like that for a few months, 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, all awful. Then they stopped again, I was relieved and confused and frustrated because I knew it wasn't normal, there's no way that's normal. it was 6 weeks until my cycle started again, and it was just as bad as they had been. It lasted 2 weeks. Ever since then it's been pretty irregular 6 to 10 weeks between periods and they last about 2 weeks. 

That is until recently, I started my most recent period on December 9th and I haven't stopped yet. Not for a single day. There are a couple days here and there that are lighter, still relatively heavy but light compared to what I've become accustomed to. I have only left my house 3 times since I started because I'm scared to be away from a bathroom for more than a few minutes. The clots are massive, and I get this intensely sharp pain in the lower right side of my abdomen whenever they pass. Which is almost nice as an alarm to empty my menstrual cup.

On the very heavy days I can barely catch my breath from the most basic of tasks. I'm not in shape but it's never been this bad. I feel like I've run around the block when all I've done is stand up from a chair or roll over in bed. I get dizzy and get headaches if I do much at all. 

Anyways I've got a doctors appointment coming up, and hopefully I'll get some answers but I was wondering in the meantime if anyone else has any experiences similar to this.

726,"Hi all. I got an IUD a little more than a month ago. I had it put in on the last day of my period that month. I then went about a week with no bleeding and no spotting at all. I then bled like never before for more than a week. (I called the office several times, I stopped bleeding and it was all good) 

----

During the very bloody week I was using a menstrual cup almost exclusively. One day when I was taking the cup out to rinse it I pulled it out and felt the sharpest cramp I've ever felt. It made me cringe with pain and cry out loud. The sharp pain only lasted about a second so I didn't think anything of it and went along with my business. 

A few days ago I had a regular ultrasound checkup on the IUD to make sure it had settled correctly. It turns out that the IUD is sitting low in my cervix and isn't positioned correctly.(to be as effective as it needs to be) 

Edit: It is also important to note that I talked to my doctor about using cups *before* I got the IUD put in and she didn't say anything of it.

----

My doctor and I decided to do another checkup in 2 months just to make sure it hasn't moved anymore. 

I am not in any pain currently and everything 'down there' seems to feel normal. 

Is it possible that the sharp cramp I felt after getting the IUD put in was because I accidentally grabbed onto the string with my cup and pulled the IUD down slightly?Would I have felt more pain from that? Would it be worth it to try and 're-do' the IUD and get another one put in?

732,"As a bit of an intro, here is my background info:  
* I have a heavy flow 99% of the time, but not so heavy that I soak through a pad every 2 hours  
* I am not on any kind of birth control, but I am *not* sexually active.  
* 99% of the time, I begin with a heavy red flow that fades in color and heaviness over 5 days or so.  
* I generally do not have menstrual problems. I will occasionally have one that is late or absent, but usually not.  
* Some months, my cramping is worse than other months, but it doesn't interrupt my life.

So my most recent flow began two days ago with very mild cramping. On both of those days, the blood was unusual. It was as heavy as it always is, but this time it's been dark brown to almost-black. 

A quick Google search returned little, but one website said that it may be because of a light flow, or because you're a slow bleeder.

But the problem with that is that I am just as heavy as I always am, and this has never happened before. This is a new occurrence, so if I was always a slow bleeder, this would be normal for me. 

And I don't think it's a clot. because clots tend to be a certain size. Women are able to describe it as ""dime-sized,"" or ""baseball-sized,"" or something like that. But this blood isn't a size. It's like a weird, messy, smearing of thick . . . *stuff.* It almost looks like black peanut butter or something.

739,"I have been bleeding from my vagina since June.




I'm just going to let that sink in for a moment.




I won't call it a period because that denotes that it had a definitive end. Which it doesn't.




To preface: I have been the girl who would go months or years at a time without getting a period with no foreseeable reason. I didn't get cramps. I went from my senior prom until my 21st birthday without a hint of spotting. In 2009, I went on the pill because boyfriend and we were doing it on the reg. The pill was wonderful; it worked like clockwork; I'd get my period on a Friday at noon. Downside was that the Wednesday before my period I would be unable to get out of bed because I would be debilitatingly depressed and I realize now vaguely suicidal. I had had enough with fucked up hormones. My women's health savvy friend essentially chanted ""IUD. IUD. IUD."" until I went to our local women's health clinic and got the ParaGuard. Literally no issues, no heavy periods, went back to my months between period lyfe.




Fast forward to June 2015: I had gotten to work, used the restroom and went to my desk to pretend to work for a bit. An hour later, I was like, ""Hmm, that's strange. Did I pee myself?"" A jaunt down to the bathroom proved that I had been murdered as there was blood from the crotch to the knees of my stylish khakis. And I was supposed to me the CEO in 5 minutes. Luckily, I had a bucket of clean laundry in my car and did a quick costume change.




And now this was a heavy AF period, and it didn't stop. And then I thought it would be stopping and it would rear its ugly head and I'd be swimming in the biblical Nile.




I consult my PCP. She gives me an appointment a month away. Fuck. I get an appointment with my OB/GYN office of the medial group. The gynecologist told me that I'm a ""weird ovulator,"" and that I should get the Miranda. ""But wacky depression-causing hormones,"" I protested! Fine, he scheduled me an internal ultrasound. And a blood test which proved that I wasn't preggo or anemic. Ultrasound was incredibly violating, the tech couldn't find my vagina for a few moments and proceeded to jab me in the clit for and I cried for 2 days afterwards. They reported that the IUD was in place.




But I still continue to bleed. Doctor writes be a script for Provera to make bleeding stop and I make an appointment to do the old switcheroo for the Mirana a few weeks out.




I awake one night after 2 hours and I once again have been murdered. Provera had not only done nothing to stem the tide, but I had saturated an extra large overnight pad (I didn't even know prior to this that they made them this big.) and the mattress. I call the on-call doctor and he prescribed more Provera. This only resulted in ping pong sized blood clots and intense pelvic pain.




A few days before my appointment, I can feel the wires poking me which had never occurred before. I go to the appointment, I'm in the torture device and the doc essentially says, ""Well, that ain't right."" and proceeded to tell me that the device had almost entirely migrated out my cervix. And then he goes to put in the new one, I start hysterically crying and inform him to please remove all equipment from my lady bits. He complies, leaves me to myself for a bit and prescribes me lorazapam for my anxiety for the next time.




It is now 2 days after the ParaGuard removal. I have bled through 4 plus sized tampons today because I normally wear pads, but today I had just had enough. My doctor prescribes another round of Provera and tells me to reschedule my Mirana appointment.




*Now my question to you, Reddit, is what the fuck? Obviously, my IUD had migrated. The ultrasound had been wrong before. Why the fuck would I get another IUD? What if it perforated my lady bits?

They flatten out while you use them so that when you pull them out you are pulling out a cotton square that is about a centimeter in height, and like 2 inches in length and width. They are not contoured like Playtex ones are. These are very uncomfortable for me to remove so I am trying to switch brands, but Playtex doesn't even make light.

752,"Hi.. I was hoping someone could help me out on a concern I have. I'll be asking my doctor but I figured I'd ask if any redditors - is that what it's called? Sorry I'm pretty new here..) had a clue what was going on or had the same thing happen to them.

Last Saturday, I bled a little bit of brown on my last active pill. I thought that was weird and that had never happened to me before. I've been on birth control for almost 6 years so it's not spotting from starting BC! So it worried me and then it got worse when I didn't even have a ""normal"" period. I usually start my period on Tuesdays, have my somewhat heavy day on Wednesday then it gets a lot lighter and it is over by Friday/Saturday. I bled dark brown from Monday to Thursday. It was more than spotting but not heavy enough to be my normal period. I know that's leftover blood but I'm not sure why I never bled red because I have always in the past. Even at times it seemed to be a discharge but I'm not quite sure because I'm unfamiliar with this happening to me during my time of the month. 

A little more information... My last period was completely normal - I had it from August 11th to August 15th. I have a boyfriend who I visited for three weeks and he's on Eastern time &amp; I'm on central so I don't know if my body didn't adjust to the time zone and the BC - I took it at the same time as I would back at home. 8 pm central so 9 pm there. It wouldn't make sense to me why that would make a difference. I missed a pill but took it the next day - I have missed a pill before (I am very good at taking them at the same time but a few times in the past it has slipped my mind after my BC alarm went off) We don't use condoms and he finishes inside me. We've been together for 2 years. I don't believe I'm pregnant nor have a std so I'm not sure what else it could be. But I'm no doctor.

I don't know if it's related, but I had an abnormal smear result as well about 8 months ago. Abnormal squamous cells, nothing they found too concerning. Also at the same time, I had a bout of genital warts. Figure it's HPV related.

I also started taking fish oil this last month and heard it could be the culprit, but I'm really not sure if that's true.

I have been sexually active this month, I believe only 2 times. There was a time where my SO ejaculated inside me, but I'm sure that was the last month and I had my period then, even still, after that time, I took a morning after pill because I guess I'm trying to be overly careful.

I just received my femmycycle cups in the mail today, and since I'm bleeding like a wounded soldier, I immediately took it for a spin. I tried the ""low cervix"" cup first (I bought the two pack for $59 on amazon). Insertion took some extra time and tenderness, but it wasn't a hassle to get in. It opens while you insert, and it is NOT supposed to open all the way, so if it seems collapsed still, it's alright.

Now 6 hours later, I removed the cup, and... low and behold, not one drop of fluid/mucus was on my fingers. Not one drop was in the toilet. The cup was nearly filled to the top, and toilet did not look like the scene of a murder.

It *did* feel like I gave surprise birth to an egg when removing, but that was mostly because I didn't continue to squeeze it while pulling it out. The cup holds 1oz total, while the more common cups hold 0.5oz at the most, so this is great for heavy bleeders.

All in all, I **highly** recommend this cup for heavy bleeders, or users of the regular cups that don't quite fit correctly/frequently leaks. This thing is seal-proof, fool-proof, leakproof, it's fairly comfy, and (so far) it doesn't pop open 5 minutes after insertion like the more common cups. 5/5 would buy.

Also, the low cervix cup fits me a bit better than the normal cup. Right now, the little loop below the regular cup is sticking out of my hooha like a drain stopper. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not really preferable, haha.",Femmycycle cup. Impressive.,0

 I have used my Divacup for less than a year now and love it. I recently started using the Dr. Bronner's gentle baby soap to clean in at the end of each cycle. It's worked okay so far, but my cup is still cloudy and has a veeeeery slight smell.

Somebody suggested I try apple cider vinegar. I put a few drops in with my Dr. Bronners, and when they mixed, my cup was filled with strange white clumps that were a pain to remove. I washed it again with just Dr. Bronner's and it appears to be how it was before.

805,"I'm just really curious if anyone else has experienced this, because I've had it for quite some time already.

A week before my period starts, that's the time when hormones start going crazy for me. I'm either miserable or horny at this time, and during the times I *am* horny, I usually get my vibrator and masturbate.

Sounds pretty normal, right? But after using my vibrator a certain number of times (sometimes 3, sometimes 2, depending on how strong it is), my period can either get delayed from a day (if I do it the day before I think I'm going to get my period) to around a week (that's when I masturbate for a certain number of days).

It got pretty scary at first, because it happened to me while I was a teenager and I thought that my egg cells were depleting or something. I found out later from a friend that the egg cells only decrease during the times when you get your period, not when you orgasm. (Though if I am wrong about this, please correct me! I would then be informed of what happens with my body. Haha!)

But when I saw the pattern, I understood that if I masturbate via vibrator too many times (plus when the vibrator's strong), my period *will* get delayed a few days. There was even one time that my period got delayed for a whole month because I kept doing it a few days after I was supposedly gonna get my period.

843,"Sorry for the wall of text but I have a lot of background story. But TL:DR my periods have changed drastically over the last 23 years and I'm concerned.

I used to have super heavy periods - I would go through 7 or 8 tampons a day. At night I would have to put a towel on my bed because I would leak through my tampon, heavy overnight pad, underwear and pajama bottoms. This was how my periods were from the age of 9-29. Super heavy, rich blood color, not too dark, not too light, but a good deep red, for 7-9 days with 3 weeks between the last day of one to the beginning of the next one. I never had too much clotting maybe one or two noticeable ones every few months. I was on birth control from 20 years old on. 
Then around 29 my periods got shorter, and I would have a few days of brown blood after- old blood I guess. So 3 day periods and 2-4 days of light, but still there brown blood.
Then a year or so later it turned into light blood - still red but not too rich. And I would have this for about 5-6 days. The thing with this is I didn't need tampons- I could get away with pantiliners and for the most part they'd be clean. Blood was only there when I wiped. It was too light for light tampons - they would come out dry even after 4 hours. 
Now I'm finally having ""real"" periods again - fresh red blood, but only need light tampons and some days just pantiliners. They're light though- and last only a few days. 
My gynecologist and my naturopath and my GP have no explanation for me other than periods change all the time. My naturopath had me go off of birth control and after a 2 month break put me on iron and maca supplements for a whole year - this seemed to mess me up even more - I would essentially have a 2 week period. Light bleeding for 4 days, no blood at all for 2 days, then my standard light period I described above (no tampons needed)for 5 days, and a few very light days after. Naturopath had no explanation for this so I stopped the treatment plan I was on.

My thyroid levels are fine, my iron is a little low but not enough to be concerned. 
The only other body changes I can link this to is weight. Until about 27 I could eat a cow and all the cheese, milk and butter it produced over it's life and A) never get ""full"" and B)  not have much effect on my weight. But I went through a year or two of weight gain after 27 - from 150ish lbs to 180. 
For the last 2 years I don't have much of an appetite, I can eat but nothing close to what I ate. Sometimes I force myself to eat a piece of bread or some rice because i'm worried about a gastritis flare if I have an empty stomach. Through all this, I now weigh 209lbs. My activity level is the same since my early 20s - yoga once or twice a week, and for the most part I keep busy throughout the day - I have an office job but everytime i've used a fitbit or anything I see that I walk close to 20,000 steps a day on average. 

I have an appointment next month with my gynecologist to get my annual. I wanted to see if anyone here has had similar changes with their periods, if you have any insight to it, what's worked for you, and if it's related to weight or if I should be looking at these two issues separately. Am I perimenopausal?

858,"Hi, 

i have always had painful cramps with my period, but i know that Ibuprofen works pretty well for me. I usually take 400mg each 6 hrs and get through the baddest 12-24 hrs until its fine. I'm doing it that way for many years now.

But i was always wondering about something. I have an app that helps me predicting my period, but of course its not too precise. If i get it one or two days earlier, its very likely it catches me in my sleep. When i wake up from the cramps, i feel there is a certain point when its already too late to take Ibuprofen, or the wrong time at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

When i get cramps at night, i don't fully wake up and just 'bear' the pains because i'm so sleepy. I even feel them in my dreams and have this half awake/half sleep state. When it gets unbearable, i take sometimes 800mg (still in bed) and it just DOESN'T WORK. 

It should work as usual within 30-40 mins (at least for me). But hours pass, and there is no sign that the pains get any way lighter. Last time it took 3 hours until it had an relieving effect. I was on the edge of crying, crouching in pain. It just gets worse and worse, and i was wondering if it is connected with my stomach or my biorhythm, that my body can't fully absorb the substance sometimes. Or is it connected with not drinking enough water to it? When i wake up at night, i just take a sip to swallow the pill. Do i need a full glass of water instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Ibuprofen seems to work for me properly only when i have eaten something before and am fully awaken and my body 'starts' getting active. Does that make any sense?

So, I've been on the pill for a while and for the last few months have had some problems with it. I saw a doctor and she told me I'm fine but that perhaps I should change the type of contraception I use. I'm cool with doing that but still want to finish the current pack of pills so that they don't go to waste - because they still work, I've just been bleeding really irregularly.

But this week my problem is that, I'm on my period right now (and it's the actual week that I'm supposed to be on my period, too), BUT my boyfriend is coming over from London to spend the weekend together and obviously I don't want to be on my period then - rn is Tuesday morning, which gives me three days to figure out what to do. What I'm asking from you guys is - would it be a good idea to start the pill, for example on Thursday? Or Friday? What if I'm still bleeding then - should I just hope it'll be over by Friday and not take the next pill until Monday? (thats when the cycle starts again). The reason why I want to take it early is 50/50 the fact that maybe it can stop the bleeding and also I'll feel more protected having sex - not planning to get pregnant any time soon :D I hope I'm making sense and perhaps smn has an idea of what would be the right thing to do.

901,"So I've always had a weird period experience compared to my friends and family members.

As far as PMS goes, 2 days before my period starts I might get bloated (if I wear anything tight enough to notice) and the night before I'm very emotional, but that's it!

But after the blood starts flowing I get all these awful symtpoms everyone else seems to get before their period! The bloating, the cramping, lower back pain, stomach pain, mild naseau, headaches, stiffness in my joints, cold sweats, bad attitude, fatigue, hunger, and it doesn't go away until the period is over.

I started my period on 11/2 and it's still going! This has never happened to me before.

&amp;#x200B;

I have symptom free periods. No cramping, nausea, exhaustion, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am on birth control. I am now 5 days into this pack and the bleeding has still not stopped.  I have been taking this birth control since 2013 with no issues. Periods have always come and gone consistently with 5-7 days of flow.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly - The first seven days of my period were exactly as expected flow wise. The seventh day I expected to be done. Now, it is a constant but very light flow of bright red blood (think second to last day flow maybe?). It is more than spotting but less than what I need for a tampon. I am currently using pantiliners.

I know the pill protects you through your placebo week but I did it to ease the mind of the person I did it with. I got my period that evening.

935," I‚Äôm not sure if I should see a gynecologist about this or not, so I‚Äôd like some input first to see if something is wrong or if it‚Äôs just that my body is naturally weird.

So, for one, my periods are and always have been really mild. I‚Äôve never used a tampon and I‚Äôve definitely never needed one. Most periods I can go through a day with only a couple pad changes. As I‚Äôve gotten older (started at 12, I‚Äôm 24 now) I‚Äôve somehow gotten even lighter and now I don‚Äôt even have a problem just wearing a normal pad at night (I used to at least need a longer one or a second one up the back because it would flow back). I can get cramps around my period, but typically just as it starts and it‚Äôs very short lived and not severe. PMS also doesn‚Äôt really affect me very much.

However, it‚Äôs my ovulation that seems to be odd. I‚Äôve always had more problems around my ovulation. Primarily, I see my mood change much more and I can get awful cramps. These cramps often are a sharp stabbing or bloating feeling in my lower stomach, near my vagina, and up my rectum. Sitting, clenching, etc. all hurt a lot. I have a high pain tolerance due to chronic pain and various chronic issues, but even these just end up too debilitating to me. It doesn‚Äôt happen every month, thank goodness, but it‚Äôs been that way since I was a teen.

I also feel very gross while ovulating? Most people tell me they feel more attractive and confident around their ovulation, which makes sense, but I feel far from. I get so much discharge it feels like I‚Äôm wetting myself and I regularly sweat, so I feel as if I need to shower two or three times a day.

The last main thing that I experience is the same type of ovulation cramping/pain, only right between my ovulation and period (so a week after my ovulation, week between my period). Thankfully, this insane cramp only happens once a cycle if it happens in a cycle, but it can last hours and leave me bedridden.

Some things I should probably note is that ibuprofen does seem to help for pain, at least to an extent. I also don‚Äôt take BC and I‚Äôm not and have never been sexually active. My doc said because I‚Äôve never been sexually active that a pap smear would be highly unnecessary, but if things are so strange I‚Äôm a bit concerned that something may be wrong.

She came off the BC pills four months ago, the first two cycles were of 31 days, the 3rd 34 days and now she's on the 40 day without signals! On the pill she was pretty regular (28 days) but now it seems that her cycle it's getting larger. Acording to the last period, we are 6 days late today.
We had sex at least four times since her last period, using condoms very carefully like we always do, so we don't really think that she could be pregnant but... who knows 
Tomorrow we are gonna buy an urine test if nothing starts to change, just to be sure and for our peace of mind, but we are really scared because it's definetely not our best moment to have a child...

Sexually active with longtime partner and we use condoms for protection. I am not on birth control and haven't been for a decade. I also haven't been to the OBGYN in about as long. 

In mid-September, I developed a bartholin cyst for the first time, which was miserable. Self-treated and recovered fully. 

Period came on time on September 24. Day 1 was normal, days 2,3,4 were exceptionally light and there was no day 5, which is unusual. I thought maybe it was due to weight loss (periods used to be 4 days when I was younger/thinner). 

Partner was a little too aggressive on Sept 29. My nipples were very sore the next day and I still have mild tenderness since then. 

According to my app, ovulation occurred on/around Oct 6, had intercourse with protection again that night. Last night (Oct. 7), I started bleeding. It was lighter than my normal period but enough where I needed a pad. Blood was pink to red and there was also a clot or other material in the toilet, and mild cramping. Went to bed hoping it would pass. Woke up with more blood and ‚Äúclotting‚Äù, but it‚Äôs still lighter in color than normal. It's more blood red today and but not dark like my normal period. I feel very bloated and have cramps, back pain and still have very mild breast tenderness.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I‚Äôve never had spotting or unusual bleeding of any kind and am very concerned. 
This right after the cyst is making me freak out and wonder what the heck is going on with my body. It‚Äôs unnerving when something unusual happens.

I have an IUD, and Im using a menstrual cup. This has been working fine, but during my last period I got terrified because I could feel my cervix so easily! Its been hard for me to reach it before but now it was so near the vagina opening. Now, Ive read that during your menstruation your cervix is lower, which is normal. I have my following menstruation now, starting yesterday, and my cervix is even lower than last time. Right over my urethral meatus/urethra? Can your cervix change position even from one menstruation to another? Ive read that the menstrual pains and amount of bleeding can be different depending on which ovary is ovalating, but position of the cervix?
Ive had the cup for maybe a year but always felt like my cervix is in the way back. My cup also intend to ""dissapear"" really far in during sleep so Ive learned to wait a couple of hours after I wake up before I take it out, because its easier. Feels like the vagina is more relaxed after a while. Normal?

I just now learned that the menstrual cup is supposed to be (for some women) in a position where your cervix is kinda inside the cup. I find this also terrifying since Im really scared I will damage the IUD, but I guess as long as I make sure I release the vacuum before taking the cup out, I should be fine. Is there anything else there I should think about or be careful with? 

Also! I think my menstrual pains are increased by the cup. Everyhing Ive read says that the vacuum should not effect the cervix or give pain, but it really feels like it does. But it could also be that the muscles in the vagina are kinda sore/tired since they are used to keep the cup in position. Thoughts? ","Help me please!

  Well, my period started when I was 12, but since that time, it was... weird, too much blood for a long time (3w or 1month almost 2) with too long pauses, lol
  Im lesbian so I wasnt worrying about being pregnant, so, yeah.
  And then some shit started happening, I was very stressed by the school, Ive been bullied and in an anxious kind of school for years, and my home wasnt very different (rofl ironically), and then... My period started, okay, 1 month later, okay, thats commom for me, 2 months... okay thats weird? Im feeling tired and such, (for u understand how much blood it was, I used to use adult diapers, and they usually get full lol), 3months after... okay lets go to a doctor make a blood exam(test? Idk). Yeah, anemy confirmed. (I could tell about the doctor that called me fat and lazy and said he was pretty sure it wasnt anemy but-- naahh (: I hate bad doctors). 
  Well, you wanna know what I had/have? Nothing lol 
  One time in ultrasound they found some cysts in my ovaries, but thats commom (poltcystic ovarian). Yeah, I made some hormonal exams too, nothing again.
  The only thing doctors told me is that this could be stress... and hell yeah I got a severe depression weeks later that time of period lol, my body was just screaming and trying to kill me because I was already too anxious, depressed and sick. (Im not counting the times I was vomiting very bad and needed to go to the hospital a lot of times, or the headaches, or the diarrheas).

All my life I‚Äôve had ‚Äúbad‚Äù periods. Debilitating cramps that left me hugging the toilet, cramps that would make normal people seek medical attention...you know what I‚Äôm saying. I was put on oral contraceptives at 13, been on them since.

Did great for years, cramps were still pretty awful but an Advil would nip them in the bud pretty easily. 

Flash forward to this last year, and now the week before my period I start getting what I can only find searches for as either a yeast infection or BV. Just very itchy, and some thicker discharge that only accumulated around my hood. No smell.
Then I start getting constipated, and then I start getting a horrible pain that lives right  in the center of my abdomen, just below my last ribs. Like bloated feeling to the max, painful to press on ( not excruciating, just very noticeably sensitive). I get horrible gas cramps, paired with my normal period cramps. 
I‚Äôve tried Advil, Midol and now anti-gas meds (Simethicone 180mg), topical pain creams (A535 extra strength) to no avail.  

As soon as my periods done it all goes away and picks back up like clockwork in a month.

I have my annual physical in December where I plan on talking to my GP about all this, but wondering if anyone else‚Äôs had these issues or has any remedies I maybe haven‚Äôt thought of.

Is anyone on a birth control that makes them never have periods? Then after they started having satisfying sex, if they stop for a few days, a period/spotting comes that doesn't end for a really long time?

I know it's hormone related and it can't be that uncommon. I just wish there was an easy way to search for information on something this specific.

Edit: Perhaps I should also add that my periods have always been pretty irregular. They never happen when they should for more than a few months at a time. This was before I went on birth control.

Ok so. I‚Äôm on birth control and have been taking it for awhile. Last month I got my period as per usual and at the end of it (Sunday) I forgot to take one of my pills. When you forget to take one of your pills you just take it as soon as you remember but I didn‚Äôt realize until my alarm went of the next day to take Monday‚Äôs pill (not a big deal I‚Äôm assuming because it just added a day to my period essentially). Over the next few weeks I forget to take a total of 4 pills, not in a row just scattered days (this never happens but I was actually on tour and tour life gets crazy hectic). 7-9 days after my period ends I start to see very dark and thick blood, and it‚Äôs now a month later and I‚Äôm still seeing that thick brown blood even after re-starting the pill on a fresh pack...I‚Äôve gone through almost a whole new pack and I‚Äôm still seeing this black and brown blood. 

Update: just got my sugar pill day and my flow is extremely heavy and bright red. When I say heavy I mean changing my tampon every hour heavy.

But... my wedding is coming in 2 days and shark week is inbound at any moment.  Two days after the wedding we are going on our honeymoon to a place that includes saunas and pools and I really would like to enjoy them.

I'm on the progestin only BC pill which makes my periods pretty light and last around 5 days.  Usually day 2-3 are my heaviest days, so I am wondering if it's safe to wear a light absorbency tampon on the lighter days?  How long is it safe to leave them in on light days?  Like I have heard you should wait to take them out until they are pretty ""soaked"" for lack of a better word, but for me on a light day that would probably mean leaving them in 8 hours which I also hear is a no no?

A few years ago my period started getting...Really jacked up. I had a period for about 7 months and it just kept getting heavier and heavier. At first I was terrified because I had no idea what was wrong and I just kept telling myself it would stop. Eventually I gave up and told my mom and I got in to the doctor as soon as I could. They did an ultrasound and did bloodwork and they didn't find anything other than me being anemic since I was bleeding so heavily.

‚Äã

My cramps would get to the point where I would pass out, my legs would give out, and I wouldn't even be able to stand up. I would be in the bathroom for hours bleeding so heavily I couldn't get off the toilet and when I finally could I wouldn't have the strength to do anything but sit on the bathroom floor for a while. I finally got on a birth control that helped it for a few months before it started up again. I went 3 months and then took the placebo pill because of how messed up my periods have been (and I still do this and my new doctor suggested I do it). Unfortunately my doctor at the time told me to double up on pills so I ended up overdosing on estrogen so not only did I have to find a new birth control but a new doctor as well because I had become suicidal.

‚Äã

Things had been going relatively well until a few months ago. I missed ONE pill because I ran out and the pharmacy refused to refill it. This happened back in late May. That same night my period started immediately and has not stopped since. My doctor now told me the only thing to do is to deal with it and lose weight. I KNOW I'm overweight (300+ pounds unfortunately due to these health issues) but with my period like this I can't lose weight at all. My bleeding is not very heavy at this moment but I'm in constant pain due to cramping, I'm exhausted all the time, and...Let's just say I'm in the bathroom a lot and it isn't due to bleeding (especially after I eat which is very strange and annoying). I also keep getting UTIs because I've been bleeding so long. I've asked about a hysterectomy before to just stop the pain and both doctors have refused because apparently I'm too young to make that decision (I'm 27).

‚Äã

After about 7 ultrasounds and a few pap smears my new doctor still can't find anything wrong with me. Luckily I'm no longer anemic because the bleeding isn't that bad but I still have 0 answers. I know sometimes I have an incredibly sharp pain on the left side and sometimes it gets so bad the pain will radiate up my side and hit about right below my ribcage. The pain keeps me up at night and trying to work + go to school full time is becoming a struggle. My cramps have gotten so bad that even my primary physician gave me a handicap in case of emergencies (like if I had to run to the grocery store to get medicine and tbh I haven't used it because despite it being mine I still feel awful about it because I'm only in my 20's and I know other people need those spots more than I do).

‚Äã

I know this is long and if you've read the whole thing thank you. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm going to be looking for another doctor soon and hopefully they can help but in the meantime has anyone ever experienced anything like this?

This is my third period ever and I'm not sure if the symptoms I'm experiencing is normal or if I should make an appointment to see my OBGYN. Here's what's been happening.

My period had been coming on for a couple of days and I had just my regular discharge, PMS symptoms and everything else that leads up to my horror show every 21 or so days. Well, last Sunday, I started bleeding...and not a little bit of bleeding but a heavy flow with blood combined with my regular vaginal discharge. I've had a lot of mild to severe cramping to go with it. If I had to rate the pain...it would probably be about a 5-6. I don't necessarily have it bad enough or sustained enough I could only stay in bed...but its bad enough I don't want to do much. Stuff like Midol, ginger and other treatments work in taking only the edge off of the pain...but it doesn't bring total relief.

They've always been pretty regular (even when I first started having them) and would only last about 4 or 5 days at most, rarely any cramps and no clots. Btw, I'm not on any birth control.

My last regular period was in February and lasted for 5 days, then after that I didn't have a period for a bit over 2 months (I wasn't pregnant because I'm still a virgin). 

Towards the end of April I got my period, but this time, it was pretty heavy, lasted for 12 days, and had blood clots. 

In May, I had one day that I thought I was starting my period then nothing after that for about 11 days. Then, I had my period for 6 days, a bit more like my usual periods but slightly heavier and with blood clots. 

Last month, I had two separate days when I thought I was starting my period because it was moderate but had nothing for about a week after the second day. Then I had a pretty heavy period for 9 days with bigger blood clots than before. 

This month, I've been having my period for about 16 days now. It started out fairly light for the first few days but then it got heavier on a few days and when I think it's about to stop, it gets heavier again. I really hope that it'll stop today, this is the longest period I've had.

I don't have any acne problems. I don't know if it's much of a difference but I'm kinda tall and slightly overweight by about 10 pounds.

I have no idea what's wrong with me and I'm getting worried. I would go to a doctor but I'm kind of tight on money right now. Does anyone know what might be happening and if it's just something that will stop soon? Or could it be PCOS?  Thank you so much!

1032,"So recently I have found that there is a debate about replacing free condoms with free menustration products.Im not a feminist but I do have to admit that this would most likely be beneficial to many women.You see,the reason to this that has been said many times is,""Sex is a choice,menustration is not."".In which I totally see the point.Now I kind of made a list of pros and cons of free condoms and free pads:

Free condoms

Pros:

‚Ä¢You don't have to worry about buying condoms from suspicious conviniant stores or gas stations that could be pretty sketchy.

‚Ä¢You can get them anytime from a trusted doctor

‚Ä¢You don't need to use money to buy them.

Cons:

‚Ä¢Teens might depend on condoms to prevent pregnancy (you still have to be cautious during sex)

‚Ä¢Condoms are more available to children and pre-teens

‚Ä¢Some condoms (glow in the dark,scented,etc.) can lead to infections.

Free Tampons/Pads:

Pros:

‚Ä¢Women don't have to spend extra money on menustration products.

‚Ä¢Women who can't afford menustration products now have easy access.

‚Ä¢Girls in school won't have to call parents,go to the school nurse,or ask others for tampons/pads

‚Ä¢Girls won't have to try to survive a day at school if they didn't bring anything and there period came unexpectedly

Cons:

‚Ä¢Companies won't make any money selling products.

‚Ä¢Companies might run out of products.

‚Ä¢Women/Girls could abuse free tampons/pads


You guys can discuss this topic however you want,just be nice about it because both ""free"" options have their pros and cons.

1033,"I'm a heavy bleeder.  In high school, on my heaviest days, I couldn't sit through a 50 minute class without changing an overnight pad.  I eventually switched to period cups with reusable pads. The cups I'm using have little volume markers under them, and hold about 30 mL of fluid, meaning I can track exactly how much I've been bleeding over time.  I generally release around 240-450 mL (avg \~310mL) of blood/fluid over 8-9 days with a cycle length of \~25 days. This means I bleed about 4.5 L per year.

However, I just read in this article:[http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/resources/very-heavy-menstrual-flow](http://www.cemcor.ubc.ca/resources/very-heavy-menstrual-flow) that the average blood released during a period is just 30 mL (less than a cup!) and that over 80 mL is considered menorrhagia (excessive, heavy bleeding).  I bleed 3x more than that on my lightest months!

Although a niagara falls of blood and jelly-like clots exit my vagina every month, I don't have any management issues. I rarely experience cramps, don't have PMS or mood swings, and it doesn't really affect my daily routine or my ability to exercise/function. I also am not anemic.

Is my extremely large menstrual flow an issue if I don't have any other side effects? How many pads do most people go through in a period? (article says around seven, but I find that number too low to believe lol)

I'm India, and in India, we universally use hand held water bidets when we visit the washroom. Since I've grown up in India, I've become comfortable with often sitting in the washroom and easily cleaning my privates with water.

Do people in other countries clean their privates in a similar fashion? I understand that toilet paper is universally used in the washroom, but it is not a bit difficult to clean the privates with just toilet paper?

1044,"So, it's been 54 days since my last period. I'm 20 years old and a healthy weight with an average time of 38 days between periods, with 30 days being the closest together they'll be and 48 days being the longest between. My period is usually 3-4 days long with 6 being the longest. I've been tracking my periods since April 2017. 

I've only cramped during my period maybe twice ever, but I get really really intense leg pains. I have nerve problems, but what happens to my legs doesn't feel like nerve pain. I'm very familiar with nerve pain. What happens feels deeper, like it's in my bones or something. It'll affect both legs, hips, knees, and sometimes ankles. I avoid exercising and walking as much as I can during my period, though it does not get any better when I'm laying down or sitting. I'll be achy a few days before my period up to either a day or so before it ends or a day after it ends. 

But, as said before, it's been 54 days, which is a really long time. I can usually predict my period by my achy legs. When my legs ache, it'll usually come in a few days, but, as of typing this, my legs feel fine and there's no other indication it'll happen any time soon. The only thing I can think of that's different is that on June 29th I upped the dosage of a prescription I take. But I can't find anything reputable-looking online that suggests gabapentin can impact someone's period as a side effect, though people on message boards and the like claim it has. 

Is any of this something to be worried about? I've mentioned the leg pain to doctors before but beyond a ""that's weird,"" nothing ever comes of me bringing it up, and being on day 54 kind of worries me. ",Inconsistent cycle durations?,0

I'm currently on Yaz and I like it the most for its other effects so I don't want to switch again, but I also can't find an answer as to why I still get a period, and why it comes on a schedule.

I take my pill every day at 7pm. Sometimes I don't get it until 7:15pm or 7:30pm, but never later than an hour (and if I do, I know to expect my period will show up a few weeks later). But, for the most part, I never take it late. Like out of a month's worth of pills, I maybe take 3-5 ""late"" (by which I mean, minutes after 7:00pm sharp). I use the period tracker app and it has averaged my period's arrival to 53 days, which is pretty spot on. So, essentially, no matter how vigilant I am about taking my pill on time, I will get a period like clockwork every other month.

I am married and presently don't use any other form of birth control (like, at all, not even ""pull and pray"") and so far I haven't gotten pregnant (phew) but... what is happening here? I have tried googling on my own to figure out if I'm somehow still fertile despite taking the pill every single day without fail (I have NEVER missed a pill entirely), but I come up empty handed. I don't understand how I'm getting a regular period, even if it's a weird, every-other-month period.

When I do get my period, it is either a hell period where I fill my Diva Cup multiple times, have intense cramping, it lasts for a week, and I just generally feel like a pile of shit, OR, it's super light (my last one was 1.5 days long), with no real symptoms other than fatigue and being a bit ratty in general :P I don't understand T\_\_T

I am not sure if I want kids (yet, or at all), but I feel more passionately about not having a period. I just... don't want it? lol. I have bipolar type 2 and avoiding the hormone fluctuations a period brings about really helps keep my mood stabilized. Moreover, I just find periods annoying lol. People (naturopaths especially) have preached to me about how a period is natural and you ""wouldn't stop pooping!"" and stuff like that, but I REALLY don't care, so please don't bother telling me. As far as I'm concerned, a period is part of reproduction, which I presently am not interested in, so why should I have to bother with the worst part of the process when I don't even know if I want kids at all? Anyhoo... my goal is to STOP my period until I decide if I want kids or not, and to understand why I'm getting a regular one at all.

For the past year, I've been suffering heavily from OCD, anxiety, and depression.

1077,"Hello, so really I‚Äôm looking for some advice // to speak to someone who is going through or has gone through the same situation as I‚Äôm currently going through. 
Apologies for the length of this post but there‚Äôs a lot to get through. 
My periods were always pretty normal back when I was younger (I‚Äôm now 21). I was put on rigevidon as a form of birth control due to heavy periods and bad pain when I was about 15/16 and was on this for approximately 3 years with no problems. I then changed to the depo, came off that after about a year due to some small issues, and then the beginning of 2017 I was put on Cerelle. I was only on Cerelle for about a month as it didn‚Äôt mix well with my mental health at all. I have now been birth control free for over a year. 
After I came off of Cerelle I didn‚Äôt begin bleeding again until August time. I had a few normal periods then basically all hell broke loose. 
I have been constantly bleeding since October last year. Some days my bleeding is minimal (but always still there) and others it‚Äôs extremely heavy. The colours range from brown, to bright red, and occasionally a very dark red. 
I‚Äôve noticed that on days where I‚Äôm not bleeding a lot, I can cough/sneeze and then out of nowhere I‚Äôm bleeding ridiculously heavily, it‚Äôs so horrible. I‚Äôve honestly forgotten what it feels like to wear underwear without a pad. 
I plucked up the courage to call the doctors about this a couple of weeks back because I‚Äôm so fed up. 
I was put on tranexamic acid to try and stop the bleeding. I took 2 x 500mg pills three times a day for four days and this didn‚Äôt help at all. After the tranexamic acid I left it a couple of weeks to see if I would stop bleeding at all but nothing has changed. So I called the doctor again earlier in the week and they‚Äôre finally getting some tests done. 
I‚Äôve had a blood test, and some swabs done to check for STI‚Äôs (although it‚Äôs been 3+ years since I‚Äôve had any sort of sex so I highly doubt it‚Äôs that) The doctor has also referred me for an ultrasound so I‚Äôm just waiting on the letter to come through with my appointment. 
If anyone has gone through anything similar at all and has any advice on what it could be and how to cope please let me know! 
Thank you :) ",Bleeding constantly for 8+ months?! Please help!!,0

My past three cycles or so, however, I've started getting some light bleeding while ovulating. I've never had that before and while I know it's normal for some people, I'm a bit worried it might mean something is wrong since I've never had that before.

I have been HEAVILY bleeding since February 1st with Baseball sized clots multiple times a day- they are so large they push out tampons.

I have an appointment this week to get a uterine biopsy. 
I have known PCOS, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and antiphosolipid antibody syndrome.

Because I'm passing large clots I cant use tampons, I cant use pads because I get blisters from them from the EDS, I cant use a menstrual cup because EDS makes all my organs super stretchy, and while I can purchase thinx panties I'm bleeding so much they won't be effective and they're pricey.

1096,"For background: I'm 19, turning 20 this month actually, and I think I must've had my first period when I was 13 or 14. Usually, periods aren't a huge deal pain\-wise. Mine are never really all that consistent; I've been really tracking them since April 2017 and the time between my periods ranges from a minimum of 30 days to a maximum for 48 days. The average is 38 days. My period is only 3\-4 days long, usually, with the longest being 6 days which has only happened once. 

The problem: Starting a few years ago, I started to get really intense leg pain during my periods. But I don't cramp. Also, I usually don't feel bloated. I usually get kind of emotional\- crying easily and all of that. Honestly, I have no frame of reference to know if I bleed a lot or not. But the leg pain is super aggravating because I don't know anyone else who gets it. It's like my bones are aching while also trying to escape my body through my skin. My pelvis aches. My ankles and hips and knees feel wrong. It sometimes feels like I have shin splints. I've felt unsteady at times and stumbled a bit, but I've never fallen, though I worry about it happening.

1099,"So the title says it all really, I've been using the evra patch for the past 5 years and it's been great. Changed it late a few times, fallen off a few times, run out and been a week or so late starting the new supply - no problems from any of this whether I had sex during those times or not!

But now I'm not so sure. I took my week off and had my period about 3 weeks ago, all fine. Did week 1/3 of the new month, which was fine except the patch got a little rucked up. Still stuck pretty firm, just less of it in contact with my skin. This has happened before so I thought nothing of it, carried on having sex as normal with my husband.

When it came to change day and I started week 2/3 by the end of my change day I was bleeding like a period (already unusual for a period. They usually start on day 3 after removing the patch) and I'm now on day 5 of bleeding (where a period would usually be 4). It seemed a couple of times like it had stopped, but sex started it back up again.

I'm wondering if the rucked up patch meant that I ovulated, got pregnant, and am now miscarrying?

I have no idea how likely that is, and because it's such a specific scenario that I had it on but it was reduced contact I can't find anything on Google!

I am wondering about my periods generally being a 39 day cycle, with only 3 days of bleeding. I have talked to 2 different gynos and neither seem concerned. I did get pregnant back in march, but had a MC.

1106,"So my last cycle was the first time I used a menstrual cup. I bought the Diva cup (stupid me, didn't do research, just though, ""oh this one seems popular so why not?"") and so far things aren't gong great, as I'm sure you've already figured out. I went through the struggle of trying to get it in, and finally managed to figure out a way to get it in without it popping open in the middle of insertion. 

Taking it out on the other hand, I still haven't mastered. Every time I take it out, because it's not folded, it stretches me and hurts like a bitch. Not sure if there's any way to avoid that. By the way, I should probably mention I'm a very small lady. 5'4"" and about 100 lbs. I have not had children. I've only had sex once in my life. 

My second issue is that the cup appears to make my already horrid, debilitating cramps worse and they last longer. I think on the second day, insertion began to get increasingly more painful each time, along with trying to fish the damn thing out of me. It felt like my vaginal walls were swollen, and it hurt so bad every time I put something in, even if it was just sliding a finger in to try to hook the rim of the cup to get it out. Eventually, I had to stop using the cup and go back to pads. After a day or maybe two, the swelling seemed to go down and I eventually went back to normal. My next cycle will be here in a couple weeks, and I want to give the cup another shot. Mostly because it was $30 and I don't wanna waste that. Just not sure if it's worth the pain. Maybe if there's nothing I can do about this, I'll either stop using it entirely or find a new cup. 

Anyone have any advice so that I'm not spending more time squatting in my bathroom, trembling, and gnashing my teeth in pain?

- Sudden, intense cramps the first day of my period. Typically, I have occasional period cramps but not this bad or this frequent/long.

I was put on birth control (FemmeTab) at 15, due to irregular periods and becoming sexually active. I was on that for 4 years, and stopped due to increasingly bad mood swings and anger. I was off that for a few months, and got a period about twice for a few days.

Wanting to try something different, I got implanon put in and had that for 9 months. Of those 9 months, I bled every day apart from 2 weeks all up. Had that taken out because high risk of anemia and bleeding every day is a just plain nuisance.

4-5 months after having implanon out, I took a weeks dosage of Primolut as I hadnt had any bleeding at all. That made me bleed for 5 days.

About 5 months after that, I was referred to a gyno to have a check up. I had a pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound done, in which all came clear (however, I'm not convinced). There was a black spot on my right kidney and my uteruses have many black spots.
I also had my hormones checked, they came back all normal.
My blood was testing for clotting ability (Vonwille brand factor, collagen assay, etc) that came back borderline. I have to redo.

She prescribed a dosage of primolut for 5 days and Levlen ED for 2 months.

Finished the primolut and started the first tablet of pill after 3 days. That made me bleed for 2 days. Currently on the 4th day of pill.

And here we are. I despise the oral pill as it doesnt fix the issue, just kind of puts a bandaid over it. I am going to take the pill for a month just to show the gyno that I trialled it. However, I do not want to take it in the long run.

1128,"I slept 14 hours, then stayed in bed for an hour on my phone.  I ate something and finally got around to taking a shower before realizing another hour had passed.  The shower was tiring so i went to lay down afterwards while my hair was still damp.  I thought maybe going outside to get coffee would help (sunlight, light exercise, caffeine) because I didn't feel alert/aware enough to drive there so I decided to walk.  I also needed to take photos for a photography assignment, but I didn't even make it past my neighborhood before I decided to go back home.  So I made tea and it didn't help, I was still tired with no motivation to do work.

It feels like I have tried everything.  I take liquid iron now and have noticed a small improvement with that, but this time I didn't notice a difference at all.  I have tried no caffeine, extra caffeine, eating healthier, eating ""whatever I feel like,"" letting myself sleep as my body wants, or setting tons of alarms, and I am always sitting around my room on my phone too tired to do anything else.  I feel exhausted as well as extreme guilt over ""wasting"" days where I have work to do and get none of it done.  I've also had these symptoms for years and with varying amounts of exercise it still persists.

Do any of you experience this? I don't want to get birth control (negative side effects) and I don't know what else to try. I sometimes miss class because I'm too tired to wake up.  It's affecting my life and I don't know what to do.

Edit 6-20-2018 (44days after original post)

Called my doctor and got blood drawn to test for thyroid and general blood info.  Results were: my red blood cell count is normal but the ferritin (iron) level is low.  This means I'm not anemic but have low iron levels.  Instructions were to continue taking iron supplements until levels return to normal.

***Also I realized that the liquid iron supplement I was taking only had an iron content of 54% dv per each 10ml, whereas a different brand I tried recently had 100% dv for 10ml.  I definitely noticed increased energy and awareness taking the latter, and the price between the two is relatively equal, so I will definitely be switching.  The liquid iron supplement I'm taking is organic and plant-sourced if that helps.
Best of luck to anyone else experiencing this.  I've been taking the liquid iron twice daily which is crucial for maintaining energy throughout the day.  I take 15/20ml right when I wake up, on an empty stomach, and then 10mg before bed (which prevents me from waking up exhausted).  I've found this to be really helpful for me.  I can probably decrease from 20ml in the morning once I switch back to the stronger liquid iron.",How to cope with extreme menstrual exhaustion/fatigue?,0

1141,"I need some help, but I've been to multiple doctors almost every week for over 2 months, and can't find help. I need a new perspective so hopefully I can get some feedback here.

I have always hated my periods, as I'm told most young girls do, but it has always seemed more intense for me. I started my periods around 12 years old, and 7 years later they have never been regular, always heavy, and always giving me intense anxiety. This anxiety was so bad that between the ages of 12 to 16, I was afraid to not wear a pad, as I would sometimes have full heavy periods every other week. Menstruating has traumatized me for years. At 16 I tried birth control for the first time, and it only took a week on regular estrogen-containing birth control for me to become extremely emotional and stop taking them. My doctor then prescribed me a norethindrone birth control, which I took successfully for 2 years with no issue. My periods were manageable, lighter but still irregular, and though I wore liners between periods, some of the anxiety had subsided. Until one month I had two periods nearly back to back, only 2 days between them and fairly heavy again. So I went back to my doctor and they suggested the Depo Provera injection, which I was told would stop my periods all together, or some spotting would occur. I went one month period free and felt relieved, when suddenly I started spotting, which I expected.... but I did not expect to bleed every day for the next two month afterward. It was horrible, I went through so many pads and my anxiety of leaking through my clothes was a daily struggle. The worst symptom by far was the flare up of depression that occurred. I went into a doctor who referred me to a gynaecologist, and after waiting 2 months for an appointment to see what my options were for controlling my periods, I was treated like garbage by the gynaecologist, who attempted to sell me on an IUD (which often make periods worse, not something I'd gamble based on my history wit bc that isn't normally known for that), and eventually I let him prescribe me hormonal birth control pills so I could leave the office, which I threw away when I got home. I was also made extremely comfortable in the office, and am now afraid to see another gynaecologist in case of a similar result. I had blood taken by a doctor and my hormone levels while off birth control aren't abnormal, so it's a mystery as to why nothing is regulating my periods. But it seems like now I'm out of options. I've been represcribed the norethindrone, but it's been making me extremely emotional too, and I can't deal with having this mental health stress. I'm in a relationship, and I can't jeopardize my mental health and put that on my partner with something as stupid as birth control, but my crazy periods affect our sexual life too, and they give me anxiety which isn't good either. I want a hysterectomy so bad (we're both ladies so we're not having kids anyway, and I think babies are disgusting), but because I'm only 19 there's hardly a chance of that no matter how bad my situation gets. I've been told doctors won't do them if you don't have kids, at all (which is bs in my opinion). 

But since I'm sort of stuck with two bad options, would anyone know of some other advice for how to stop periods without birth control, or what to do next, any other kind of specialist I could see? I'm Canadian so health cost isn't usually an issue. 
Any advice is welcome (though I'm not interested in comments about my stance on kids or removing my uterus, I've heard every line and it makes no difference to me, I decided a long tome ago I wasn't having kids of my own, adopting after I've checked child-free things off my bucket list seems like a better idea for me).

I'm going to use words like vagina, clotting, hemorrhagic, and give in depth descriptions of my experience. This isn't meant to be offensive, just food for thought. If I've learned anything, it's that someone will go through this eventually and will need this info to make an educated decision.

Skip the next few paragraphs if you don't care about my reproductive stuff.

Suh, dude. I am an x chromosome, with fibroids, ovarian cysts, and hemorrhagic bleeding. I am 98% infertile and go to the ER for pain medications every few cycles because I physically can't walk during some mensies.

I burn through 4 super tampons on a regular flow day. I've had the best luck with pads, as they're more absorbent and less likely to leak all over my damn scrubs. In January 2018 I switched to reusable period products, because I was spending upwards of $40 per month to manage my period.

I bought a set of 5 bamboo reusable pads, and a set of standard/small menstrual cups. After their arrival (thanks amazon) I made an appointment with my GYN to get my mandatory yearly exam and ask if I was safe to use the menstrual cup. I do have a uterine IUD for birth control. After an ultrasound, pap, and exam I had the string trimmed and was given the ok to use the cup. I was also instructed to take 400 mg of ibuprofen two times a day every day I'm menstruating to lessen the flow. Consult your doctor about this before you try. Ibuprofen can fry your kidneys.

***Actual review now***

So the reusable pads need to be used a few times to reach maximum absorbency. The ones I picked were bamboo fiber. I wash all my clothes in biodegradable detergent and distilled white vinegar. DO NOT DRY WITH HEAT. I rinse with cold water and wring them out gently after use until the water is mostly clear. They go into a plastic zip bag until I have enough to wash (smells bad after a few days, I'm still working out the kinks) then hang dry in the bathroom when they're out if the washer. They dry within 24 hours. I can't reccomend reusable bamboo pads enough. They're not smelly and last most of the day if I use the bathroom often and do frequent cleaning of my perineal area (vagina). 

The cup was difficult to size, but after some trial and error I got the position right. Contrary to advertisment, if your heavy flow you'll want to empty it every time you use the bathroom. I take it out to have a bowel movement (poop) because it has slid down when I push. I'd highly reccomend wearing a pad during your first few uses, because getting a good seal is tricky.

To remove, bear down first. If you don't it will make an uncomfortable suction, even if the cup you choose has holes near the rim.

Since I am hemmoragic (I bleed a ton) using them over night doesn't work. I just go with pads to catch the ""drop"" when I stand up, the use the cup for the day time.

I know it's kind of a weird recommendation, but I use adult toy sanitizer to clean my cup after my cycle has finished. Most cups are made from silicone, and I only boil them when I first receive them. You don't have to have an adult toy to buy the sanitizer that's silicone safe. Just order it from Amazon or venture to an adult store (if you're over the age of consent) and pick up some. It's a life saver if you get frequent infections in your vagina. If you need a parents permission, just explain why you need it and hope for the best. If your parent or guardian doesn't consent *please boil your cup after every cycle*

***Do not use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to sanitize anything silicone***

I hope this helps someone. I will always be open to any PMs or comments regarding questions. Periods suck, and sometimes there isn't a safe place to talk about these things. Gynecology is sorely lacking in education, and every person with a vagina deserves to know what is going on down there.

November 2017: My husband has fallen into a coma and I end up needing to call a friend for pads because I wasn't even thinking about my period and now I have a pile of toilet paper stuck in my boxers. This is 100% a period and lasts about 8 or 9 days. I don't do anything because I am literally living in the hospital (they have a shower in the basement).

December 2017: I get my period about 4 days after my husband dies. I go to CVS and get pads and mostly try to forget that it is Christmas or that happiness ever existed. 

January 2018: It... happens again. It's very heavy (5-6 overnight pads a day) for 12 days. I moved in with friends who had a spare room shortly after my husband died and when they realize, they tell me to go to the doctor.

The doctor is concerned. He draws blood again with the same results - I have normal testosterone levels and should not be menstruating. He orders a transvaginal ultrasound which... is a nightmare for me. But the results came back perfectly normal. The cramps are jaw droppingly awful and I am prescribed tramadol.

By the end of my period, I am getting contact dermatitis from using pads, which was a big problem before my transition, just because of how long the period is. I hie my ass down to Whole Foods and pick up a Lunette (size 1/25 ml), which was my menstrual cup of choice before T. Happily, using a menstrual cup is apparently like riding a bike.

February: And again. Using the Lunette, I have a roughly better idea of ml of blood. For the first four days, I have to change my cup 4 times a day and wear it with an overnight pad to sleep. The next 5 days I change it three times a day and can get through the night (I sleep about six hours). After that, until day 14, I change it twice a day. I am sent to an OBGYN who is trans knowledgeable.

I see the OBGYN who does not do a physical exam but orders more blood tests and tells me to go back to my GP. Blood tests, which look at my hormone landscape far more extensively, come back perfectly normal for a man my age and do not explain why I am menstruating. According to my blood profile, this should not be happening. I am also not anemic and do not have any apparent nutrition or vitamin deficiencies.

I have a seizure while walking home from work (first time). Over Facebook, an aunt lets me know that my paternal family has a history of hormone related grand mal seizures and my aunts/cousins have managed that with hormone replacement therapy. I am told I cannot take tramadol because it lowers seizure thresholds.

I see my neurologist who says he does not specialize in seizures, but orders an EEG and MRI. I have not yet done them because I am grieving in a very serious way and I just. cannot. handle. all. of. this. without. him. Literally, getting my period now isn't just a dysphoria trigger, it's a reminder that I am alone.

March: I started spotting yesterday, after a day of cramps that were so bad I literally couldn't get up from my desk at work. Today, by 1:30, I had changed my Lunette 3 times. I anticipate needing to change it at least 2 more times today before bed and will probably set an alarm to change it in the middle of the night. Passing small clots as well, blueberry/pea sized. 

I'm... an emotional mess right now and in pretty agonizing pain from the cramping that's been pretty unabated since Friday. I have a doctor's appointment (standing) next week, so I don't see a point in making another one and needing to take PTO for it when the situation literally hasn't changed. I don't think I am at the point where period has turned into hemorrhage (although I admittedly don't exactly remember the ml guidelines the nurse gave me, the clots aren't big enough). I am just so miserable and no one in the medical field seems to know what's going on or how to help.

*

From the beginning medical professionals have suggested that a total hysterectomy would obviously resolve this issue. In October, when I spoke to my husband about it, we decided it would be a final resort if it became a major unsolvable problem (we did not expect it to be). Right now, it really isn't on the table. I am not in a position any longer where major surgery/medical trauma/hospital settings like that are remotely palatable or non-traumatic. I have had to tell every single doctor this fact and I am getting tired of it.

1180,"My cycle is fairly regular at about 28-30 days, but I begin having intense cramping and swelling around day 25. In a few months, I have an important event coming up and don't want to be on my period during it. Unfortunately, this is when I'm due. Has anyone had success with manipulating their cycle through herbal remedies, diet, etc? I'm hoping that since my cramping begins a few days before, I might be able to ""budge"" my cycle by a few days over the next few months.

1182,"So my roommate has no health insurance. She applied to the only indigent care program near us, and never heard anything back. Without the acceptance into the program, they'd charge her $1,900 for a gyno visit. So I know any advice here won't be professional, but she's in a bind. She did some research on her own, but A) She gets queasy reading medical stuff, B) I'm more familiar with medical term and concepts (though I am not a professional), and C) I'm better at research than she is. So here comes the facts:   

1) For years, my roommate has had periods that last 1 to 2 months. She sometimes gets a 1 to 2 day break from bleeding, but she goes right back to bleeding after that.  
2) She has no pain except in her lower back and legs, which may or may not be related.  
3) She also passes a lot of blood clots.  
4) She experiences fatigue as well, which makes sense because of the duration of her periods.  
5) She has tried going gluten-free, but it didn't help.  

What she wants is something that will help ease the symptoms somewhat until she can find a more permanent solution. sHe will also take ideas as to what is going on.

As far as treatment ideas, she is also open to herbal and natural remedies. In her research, she found out about three natural remedies: Sabina Officinalis, Thlaspi Bursa Pastons, and Fibrava. But she doesn't want to make a choice before she knows a bit more about their safety.

Can anyone offer her any help?
